Modi , a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party -LRB- BJP -RRB- , is a Hindu nationalist and member of the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -LRB- RSS -RRB- .   Born to a Gujarati family in Vadnagar , Modi helped his father sell tea as a child , and later ran his own stall . He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight , beginning a long association with the organisation . He left home after graduating from school , partly because of an arranged marriage which he rejected . Modi traveled around India for two years , and visited a number of religious centres . He returned to Gujarat and moved to Ahmedabad in 1969 or 1970 . In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS . During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975 , Modi was forced to go into hiding . The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 , and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001 , rising to the rank of general secretary .   Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 , due to Keshubhai Patel 's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj . Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after . His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots , or otherwise criticised for its handling of it , although a court found no evidence to prosecute Modi . His policies as chief minister , credited with encouraging economic growth , have received praise . His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health , poverty , and education indices in the state .   Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election , which gave the party a majority in the Lok Sabha , the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984 .

Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics , Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots , cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda .

He also wrote the Beatles ' songs `` Do n't Pass Me By '' and `` Octopus 's Garden '' , and is credited as a co-writer of others , including `` What Goes On '' and `` Flying '' .   Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood , and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations fell behind in school . In 1955 , he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer . Soon afterwards , he became interested in the UK skiffle craze , developing a fervent admiration for the genre . In 1957 , he cofounded his first band , the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group , which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958 .

After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg , he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962 , replacing Pete Best .

His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song . '' He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998 . In 2011 , Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time . Starr , who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988 , was inducted for his solo career in 2015 , making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once . "]}

{"id":95026,"label":"REFUTES","claim":"The Apple Store originally opened in multiple locations.","evidence_en":["Apple Store is a chain of retail stores owned and operated by Apple Inc. . The stores sell Mac personal computers , iPhone smartphones , iPad tablet computers , iPod portable media players , Apple Watch smartwatches , Apple TV digital media players , software , and select third-party accessories .   The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs , after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts . Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company 's products , he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers , and hired Ron Johnson in 2000 . Jobs relaunched Apple 's online store in 1997 , and opened the first two physical stores in 2001 . Despite initial media speculation that Apple would fail , its stores were highly successful , bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$ 1 billion in annual sales , becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so . Over the years , Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage , with 496 stores across 21 countries worldwide as of May 2017 . Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores , with sales over $ 16 billion globally in 2011 .   In May 2016 , Angela Ahrendts , Apple 's current Senior Vice President of Retail , unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in Union Square , San Francisco , featuring large glass doors for the entry , open spaces , and rebranded rooms . In addition to purchasing products , consumers can get advice and help from `` Creative Pros '' - individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts ; get product support in a tree-lined Genius Grove ; and attend sessions , conferences and community events , with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into `` town squares '' , a place where people naturally meet up and spend time . The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide , a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close .   Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls , but Apple has built several stand-alone `` flagship '' stores in high-profile locations . It has been granted design patents and received architectural awards for its stores ' designs and construction , specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes . The success of Apple Stores have had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers , who have lost traffic , control and profits due to a perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores . Apple 's notable brand loyalty have historically caused long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases . Due to the popularity of the brand , there are numerous job applications , many of which from young workers . Although Apple Store employees receive above-average pay , are offered money toward education and health care , and receive product discounts , there are limited or no paths of career advancement . A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a hostile work environment with harassment from customers , intense internal criticism , and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts .

Ellick made a New York Times documentary about her life as the Pakistani military intervened in the region . She rose in prominence , giving interviews in print and on television , and she was nominated for the International Children 's Peace Prize by activist Desmond Tutu .   On the afternoon of 9 October 2012 , Yousafzai was injured after a Taliban gunman attempted to murder her . Yousafzai remained unconscious , in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology , but later her condition improved enough for her to be sent to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham , UK . The murder attempt sparked a national and international outpouring of support for Yousafzai . Deutsche Welle wrote in January 2013 that she may have become `` the most famous teenager in the world . '' Weeks after her murder attempt , a group of fifty leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatw\u0101 against those who tried to kill her .   Since recovering , Yousafzai became a prominent education activist . Based out of Birmingham , she founded the Malala Fund , a non-profit , and in 2013 co-authored I am Malala , an international bestseller . In 2015 , Yousafzai was a subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala . The 2013 , 2014 and 2015 issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most Influential people globally . In 2012 , she was the recipient of Pakistan 's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize . In 2014 , she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize , along with Kailash Satyarthi , for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education . Aged 17 at the time , she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate . Since March 2013 , she has been a pupil at the all-girls ' Edgbaston High School in Birmingham .

Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah -LRB- the Christ -RRB- was prophesied in the Old Testament .   Christian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles ' Creed and Nicene Creed . These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , descended into hell , and rose from the dead , in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins . The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven , where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit , and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers . His incarnation , earthly ministry , crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as `` the gospel '' , meaning `` good news '' . `` Good news '' is a translation of the Ancient Greek term \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd euang\u00e9lion , from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive . The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus 's life and teaching , four of which -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible .   Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century . Originating in Judea , it quickly spread to Europe , Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor , Transcaucasia , Egypt , Ethiopia and India , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire . Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization . Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .   Throughout its history , Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations . Worldwide , the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism . The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East -- West Schism of 1054 ; Protestantism came into existence in the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Catholic Church .

Singapore 's territory consists of one main island along with 62 other islets . Since independence , extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23 % -LRB- 130 km2 -RRB- , and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora , parks and gardens .   Stamford Raffles founded colonial Singapore in 1819 as a trading post of the East India Company ; after its collapse and the eventual establishment of the British Raj , the islands were ceded to Britain and became part of its Straits Settlements in 1826 . During the Second World War , Singapore was occupied by Japan . It gained independence from the UK in 1963 by federating with other former British territories to form Malaysia , but separated two years later over ideological differences , becoming a sovereign nation in 1965 . After early years of turbulence , and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland , the nation developed rapidly as an Asian Tiger economy , based on external trade and its workforce .

{"id":115053,"label":"REFUTES","claim":"Anti-nuclear antibodies has zero subtypes.","evidence_en":["Antinuclear antibodies -LRB- ANAs , also known as antinuclear factor or ANF -RRB- are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus . In normal individuals , the immune system produces antibodies to foreign proteins -LRB- antigens -RRB- but not to human proteins -LRB- autoantigens -RRB- . In some individuals , antibodies to human antigens are produced .   There are many subtypes of ANAs such as anti-Ro antibodies , anti-La antibodies , anti-Sm antibodies , anti-nRNP antibodies , anti-Scl-70 antibodies , anti-dsDNA antibodies , anti-histone antibodies , antibodies to nuclear pore complexes , anti-centromere antibodies and anti-sp100 antibodies . Each of these antibody subtypes binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus . They are found in many disorders including autoimmunity , cancer and infection , with different prevalences of antibodies depending on the condition . This allows the use of ANAs in the diagnosis of some autoimmune disorders , including systemic lupus erythematosus , Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome , scleroderma , mixed connective tissue disease , polymyositis , dermatomyositis , autoimmune hepatitis and drug induced lupus .   The ANA test detects the autoantibodies present in an individual 's blood serum . The common tests used for detecting and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay -LRB- ELISA -RRB- . In immunofluorescence , the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre . This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable . Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant . Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20 % of the healthy population , especially the elderly . Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders , they are also found in 5 % of healthy individuals . Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease . A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present . "]}

{"id":43345,"label":"REFUTES","claim":"My Sweet Lord was written by Harrison in 1998.","evidence_en":["`` My Sweet Lord '' is a song by English musician and former Beatle , George Harrison . It was released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass . Also issued as a single , Harrison 's first as a solo artist , `` My Sweet Lord '' topped charts worldwide and was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK . In America and Britain , the song was the first number one single by an ex-Beatle . Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 .   Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's much-admired slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as being `` musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro '' . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording .   Later in the 1970s , `` My Sweet Lord '' was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit , due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song `` He 's So Fine '' , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright `` Oh Happy Day '' , a Christian hymn , as his inspiration for the song 's melody .   Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked the song as `` My Sweet Lord -LRB- 2000 -RRB- '' for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass . Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams , Peggy Lee , Edwin Starr , Johnny Mathis , Nina Simone , Julio Iglesias , Richie Havens , Megadeth , Boy George , Elton John , Jim James , Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith . `` My Sweet Lord '' is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of `` the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002 , two months after Harrison 's death . "]}

Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War -LRB- 1937 -- 45 -RRB- , after Japan 's defeat China 's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao 's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan .   On 1 October 1949 , Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- , a one-party state controlled by the CPC . In the following years Mao solidified his control through a campaign of classicide against landlords , and a mass purge of perceived enemies of the state he termed as `` counter-revolutionaries '' alleged to have caused between 2,000,000 to 6,000,000 deaths . -LRB- Mao himself admitting 800,000 deaths in the classicide and 712,000 in the suppression of Counterrevolutionaries -RRB- In 1957 , he launched the Great Leap Forward campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China 's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one . The campaign contributed to a widespread famine , whose death toll is estimated at between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 . In 1966 , he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , a program to remove `` counter-revolutionary '' elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle that killed 400,000 to 10,000,000 people , widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao 's personality cult . In 1972 , Mao welcomed American President Richard Nixon in Beijing , signalling a policy of opening China , which was furthered under the rule of Deng Xiaoping -LRB- 1978 -- 1992 -RRB- . Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 , and died in September , aged 82 . He was succeeded as Paramount leader by Hua Guofeng -LRB- 1976 -- 1978 -RRB- , who was quickly sidelined and replaced by Deng .   A controversial figure , Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history , and is also known as a theorist , military strategist , poet and visionary . Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China , modernising China and building it into a world power , promoting the status of women , improving education and health care , and increasing life expectancy as China 's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million under his leadership . In contrast , critics consider him a dictator comparable to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin who damaged traditional Chinese culture , as well as considering him a perpetrator of human rights abuses , and they estimate that Mao was responsible for 40 to 70 million deaths through starvation , prison labour and executions , which would rank his tenure as the top incidence of excess mortality in human history .

A three-time Formula One World Champion , he is regarded by fellow and former drivers as one of the greatest Formula One drivers in the history of the sport . He won his first title with McLaren in 2008 before moving to Mercedes , where he won back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 .   In December 1995 , at the age of ten , he approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards ceremony and told him , `` I want to race for you one day ... I want to race for McLaren . '' Less than three years later McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to their Young Driver Support Programme . After winning the British Formula Renault , Formula Three Euroseries , and GP2 championships on his way up the racing career ladder , he drove for McLaren in 2007 , making his Formula One debut 12 years after his initial encounter with Dennis . Hamilton 's contract for the McLaren driver development program made him the youngest ever driver to secure a contract which later resulted in a Formula One drive .   Coming from a mixed background , with a black father and white mother , Hamilton is the first black driver to race in Formula One . Hamilton commented on this , saying `` The way I see it , my colour is an advantage in that it 's something people talk about '' , `` Being the first black man does n't matter much to me personally , but for the sport itself it probably means quite a lot . ''   In his first season in Formula One , Hamilton set numerous records while finishing second in the 2007 Formula One Championship , just one point behind Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen . He won the World Championship the following season in dramatic fashion , becoming the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history before Sebastian Vettel broke the record two years later . Following his second world title in 2014 , he was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year .

{"id":25272,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"Elizabeth I of England was known as Gloriana.","evidence_en":["Elizabeth I -LRB- 7 September 1533 -- 24 March 1603 -RRB- was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death . Sometimes called The Virgin Queen , Gloriana or Good Queen Bess , the childless Elizabeth was the last monarch of the Tudor dynasty .   Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn , his second wife , who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth 's birth . Anne 's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled , and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate . Her half-brother , Edward VI , ruled until his death in 1553 , bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters , Elizabeth and the Roman Catholic Mary , in spite of statute law to the contrary . Edward 's will was set aside and Mary became queen , deposing Lady Jane Grey . During Mary 's reign , Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels .   In 1558 , Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel . She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers , led by William Cecil , 1st Baron Burghley . One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church , of which she became the Supreme Governor . This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England . It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir to continue the Tudor line . She never did , despite numerous courtships . As she grew older , Elizabeth became famous for her virginity . A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits , pageants , and literature of the day .   In government , Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been . One of her mottoes was `` video et taceo '' -LRB- `` I see but say nothing '' -RRB- . In religion , she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution . After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her , several conspiracies threatened her life , all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers ' secret service . Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs , manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain . She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective , poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands , France , and Ireland . By the mid-1580s , England could no longer avoid war with Spain . England 's defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history .   Elizabeth 's reign is known as the Elizabethan era . The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama , led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe , and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake . Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered , sometimes indecisive ruler , who enjoyed more than her share of luck . Towards the end of her reign , a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity . Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited , and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones . Such was the case with Elizabeth 's rival , Mary , Queen of Scots , whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587 . After the short reigns of Elizabeth 's half-siblings , her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity . "]}

Famous for playing comic `` dumb blonde '' characters , she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s , emblematic of the era 's attitudes towards sexuality . Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade , her films grossed $ 200 million by the time of her unexpected death in 1962 . She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon .   Born and raised in Los Angeles , Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen . While working in a factory in 1944 as part of the war effort , she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career . The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox -LRB- 1946 -- 1947 -RRB- and Columbia Pictures -LRB- 1948 -RRB- . After a series of minor film roles , she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951 . Over the next two years , she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies , including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business , and in the dramas Clash by Night and Do n't Bother to Knock . Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star , but rather than damaging her career , the story resulted in increased interest in her films .   By 1953 , Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars , with leading roles in three films : the noir Niagara , which focused on her sex appeal , and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire , which established her star image as a `` dumb blonde '' . Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career , she was disappointed at being typecast and underpaid by the studio . She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project , but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career , The Seven Year Itch -LRB- 1955 -RRB- .   When the studio was still reluctant to change her contract , Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954 ; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions -LRB- MMP -RRB- . She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio . In late 1955 , Fox awarded her a new contract , which gave her more control and a larger salary . After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop -LRB- 1956 -RRB- and acting in the first independent production of MMP , The Prince and the Showgirl -LRB- 1957 -RRB- , she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like It Hot -LRB- 1959 -RRB- . Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits -LRB- 1961 -RRB- .   Monroe 's troubled private life received much attention . She struggled with substance abuse , depression , and anxiety . She had two highly publicized marriages , to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and playwright Arthur Miller , both of which ended in divorce . On August 5 , 1962 , she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in Los Angeles . Although Monroe 's death was ruled a probable suicide , several conspiracy theories have been proposed in the decades following her death . "]}

{"id":129671,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"Carbon is an element.","evidence_en":["Carbon -LRB- from carbo `` coal '' -RRB- is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6 . It is nonmetallic and tetravalent -- making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds . Three isotopes occur naturally , C and C being stable , while C is a radioactive isotope , decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years . Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity .   Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust , and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium , and oxygen . Carbon 's abundance , its unique diversity of organic compounds , and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life . It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass -LRB- about 18.5 % -RRB- after oxygen .   The atoms of carbon can bond together in different ways , termed allotropes of carbon . The best known are graphite , diamond , and amorphous carbon . The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form . For example , graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent . Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper -LRB- hence its name , from the Greek verb '' \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd '' which means `` to write '' -RRB- , while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known . Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity . Under normal conditions , diamond , carbon nanotubes , and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials . All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions , with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form . They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen .   The most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4 , while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes . The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones , dolomites and carbon dioxide , but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal , peat , oil , and methane clathrates . Carbon forms a vast number of compounds , more than any other element , with almost ten million compounds described to date , and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions . For this reason , carbon has often been referred to as the `` king of the elements '' . "]}

Vienna is Austria 's primary city , with a population of about 1.8 million -LRB- 2.6 million within the metropolitan area , nearly one third of Austria 's population -RRB- , and its cultural , economic , and political centre . It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union . Until the beginning of the 20th century , it was the largest German-speaking city in the world , and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I , the city had 2 million inhabitants . Today , it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin . Vienna is host to many major international organizations , including the United Nations and OPEC . The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic , Slovakia , and Hungary . These regions work together in a European Centrope border region . Along with nearby Bratislava , Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants . In 2001 , the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site .   Apart from being regarded as the City of Music because of its musical legacy , Vienna is also said to be `` The City of Dreams '' because it was home to the world 's first psycho-analyst -- Sigmund Freud . The city 's roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city , and then the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading European music centre , from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century . The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles , including Baroque castles and gardens , and the late-19th-century Ringstra\u00dfe lined with grand buildings , monuments and parks .   Vienna is known for its high quality of life . In a 2005 study of 127 world cities , the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first -LRB- in a tie with Vancouver , Canada and San Francisco , USA -RRB- for the world 's most liveable cities .

Between 2005 and 2010 , Vienna was the world 's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions . It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year . ","Austria -LRB- listen -RRB- , is a federal republic and a landlocked country of over 8.7 million people in Central Europe . It is bordered by the Czech Republic and Germany to the north , Hungary and Slovakia to the east , Slovenia and Italy to the south , and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west . The territory of Austria covers 83879 km2 . The terrain is highly mountainous , lying within the Alps ; only 32 % of the country is below 500 m , and its highest point is 3798 m . The majority of the population speaks local Bavarian dialects of German as their native language , and Austrian German in its standard form is the country 's official language . Other local official languages are Hungarian , Burgenland Croatian , and Slovene .   The origins of modern-day Austria date back to the time of the Habsburg dynasty , when the vast majority of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire . From the time of the Reformation , many northern German princes , resenting the authority of the Emperor , used Protestantism as a flag of rebellion . The Thirty Years War , the influence of the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of France , the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia , and the Napoleonic invasions all weakened the power of the Emperor in the north of Germany , but in the south , and in non-German areas of the Empire , the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control . During the 17th and 18th centuries , Austria retained its position as one of the great powers of Europe and , in response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French , the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804 . Following Napoleon 's defeat , Prussia emerged as Austria 's chief competitor for rule of a greater Germany . Austria 's defeat by Prussia at the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz , during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 , cleared the way for Prussia to assert control over the rest of Germany . In 1867 , the empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary . After the defeat of France in the 1870-1 Franco-Prussian War , Austria was excluded from the new German Empire , although in the following decades , its politics , and its foreign policy , increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led Empire . During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28 , Austria-Hungary , emboldened by a pledge of German support , on July 28 declared war on Serbia because that country had not fully complied with an Austrian ultimatum . Austria was thus the first to go to war in the July Crisis , which would ultimately escalate into World War I.   After the collapse of the Habsburg -LRB- Austro-Hungarian -RRB- Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I , Austria adopted and used the name the Republic of German-Austria -LRB- Deutsch\u00f6sterreich -RRB- , later changed to \u00d6sterreich , in an attempt at union with Germany , but this was forbidden under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye -LRB- 1919 -RRB- . The First Austrian Republic was established in 1919 . In 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss . This lasted until the end of World War II in 1945 , after which Germany was occupied by the Allies and Austria 's former democratic constitution was restored . In 1955 , the Austrian State Treaty re-established Austria as a sovereign state , ending the occupation . In the same year , the Austrian Parliament created the Declaration of Neutrality which declared that the Second Austrian Republic would become permanently neutral .   Today , Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states . The capital and largest city , with a population exceeding 1.7 million , is Vienna . Other major urban areas of Austria include Graz , Linz , Salzburg and Innsbruck . Austria is one of the richest countries in the world , with a nominal per capita GDP of $ 43,724 . The country has developed a high standard of living and in 2014 was ranked 21st in the world for its Human Development Index . Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955 , joined the European Union in 1995 , and is a founder of the OECD . Austria also signed the Schengen Agreement in 1995 , and adopted the euro currency in 1999 . "]}

Taft was elected president in 1908 , the chosen successor of Theodore Roosevelt , but was defeated for re-election by Woodrow Wilson in 1912 after Roosevelt split the Republican vote by running as a third-party candidate . In 1921 , President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft to be chief justice , a position in which he served until a month before his death .   Taft was born in Cincinnati in 1857 . His father , Alphonso Taft , was a U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of War . William Taft attended Yale and was a member of Skull and Bones secret society like his father , and after becoming a lawyer was appointed a judge while still in his twenties . He continued a rapid rise , being named Solicitor General and as a judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals . In 1901 , President William McKinley appointed Taft civilian governor of the Philippines . In 1904 , Roosevelt made him Secretary of War , and he became Roosevelt 's hand-picked successor . Despite his personal ambition to become chief justice , Taft declined repeated offers of appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States , believing his political work to be more important .   With Roosevelt 's help , Taft had little opposition for the Republican nomination for president in 1908 , and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November . In the White House , he focused on East Asia more than European affairs , and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments . Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs , then a major source of governmental income , but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests . His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative wing of the Republican Party , with which Taft often sympathized , and the progressive wing , toward which Roosevelt moved more and more . Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men . Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912 . Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates , and Roosevelt bolted the party . The split left Taft with little chance of re-election ; he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson 's victory .   After leaving office , Taft returned to Yale as a professor , continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace . In 1921 , President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice , an office he had long sought . Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues , but under him , there were advances in individual rights . In poor health , he resigned in February 1930 . After his death the next month , he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery , the first president and first Supreme Court justice to be interred there . Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians ' rankings of U.S. presidents . "]}

Cosmetics applied to the face to enhance its appearance are often called make-up or makeup .   In the U.S. , the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- , which regulates cosmetics , defines cosmetics as `` intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing , beautifying , promoting attractiveness , or altering the appearance without affecting the body 's structure or functions '' . This broad definition includes any material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product . The FDA specifically excludes soap from this category . ","A cleanser is a facial care product that is used to remove make-up , dead skin cells , oil , dirt , and other types of pollutants from the skin of the face . This helps to unclog pores and prevent skin conditions such as acne . A cleanser can be used as part of a skin care regimen together with a toner and moisturizer .   Using a cleanser to remove dirt is considered to be a better alternative to bar soap or another form of skin cleanser not specifically formulated for the face for the following reasons :  Bar soap has a high pH -LRB- in the area of 9 to 10 -RRB- , and the skin 's surface pH is on average 4.7 . This means that soap can change the balance present in the skin to favor the overgrowth of some types of bacteria , increasing acne .  Bar cleansers have thickeners that allow them to assume a bar shape . These thickeners can clog pores , leading to acne .  Using bar soap on the face can remove natural oils from the skin that form a barrier against water loss . This causes the sebaceous glands to subsequently overproduce oil , a condition known as reactive seborrhoea , which will lead to clogged pores . In order to prevent drying out the skin , many cleansers incorporate moisturizers . "]}

He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia . After founding the Empire and being proclaimed `` Genghis Khan '' , he started the Mongol invasions that conquered most of Eurasia . Campaigns initiated in his lifetime include those against the Qara Khitai , Caucasus , and Khwarazmian , Western Xia and Jin dynasties . These campaigns were often accompanied by large-scale massacres of the civilian populations -- especially in the Khwarazmian and Western Xia controlled lands . By the end of his life , the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China .   Before Genghis Khan died he assigned \u00d6gedei Khan as his successor . Later his grandsons split his empire into khanates . He died in 1227 after defeating the Western Xia . He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia . His descendants extended the Mongol Empire across most of Eurasia by conquering or creating vassal states in all of modern-day China , Korea , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and substantial portions of Eastern Europe and Southwest Asia . Many of these invasions repeated the earlier large-scale slaughters of local populations . As a result , Genghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories .   Beyond his military accomplishments , Genghis Khan also advanced the Mongol Empire in other ways . He decreed the adoption of the Uyghur script as the Mongol Empire 's writing system . He also practiced meritocracy and encouraged religious tolerance in the Mongol Empire , and unified the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia . Present-day Mongolians regard him as the founding father of Mongolia .   Although known for the brutality of his campaigns and considered by many to have been a genocidal ruler , Genghis Khan is also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment . This brought communication and trade from Northeast Asia into Muslim Southwest Asia and Christian Europe , thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas . "]}

Turkey is a democratic , secular , unitary , parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Turkey is bordered by eight countries : Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest ; Georgia to the northeast ; Armenia , the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east ; Iraq and Syria to the south . The country is encircled by seas on three sides : the Aegean Sea is to the west , the Black Sea to the north , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . The Bosphorus , the Sea of Marmara , and the Dardanelles , which together form the Turkish Straits , divide Thrace and Anatolia ; they also separate Europe and Asia . Ankara is the capital while Istanbul is the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . Approximately 70-80 % of the country 's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks . Other ethnic groups include legally recognised -LRB- Armenians , Greeks , Jews -RRB- and unrecognised -LRB- Kurds , Arabs , Circassians , Albanians , Bosniaks , Georgians , etc. -RRB- minorities . Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group , making up approximately 20 % of the population .   The area of Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations , as well as Assyrians , Greeks , Thracians , Phrygians , Urartians and Armenians . After Alexander the Great 's conquest , the area was Hellenized , a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire . The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century , starting the process of Turkification , which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . The Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks .   In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa , becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period . The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century , especially during the reign -LRB- 1520 -- 1566 -RRB- of Suleiman the Magnificent . It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries , until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe , signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth . After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers . During the war , the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian , Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens .   Following the war , the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states . The Turkish War of Independence -LRB- 1919 -- 1922 -RRB- , initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk and his colleagues against the occupying Allies , resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 , with Atat\u00fcrk as its first president . Atat\u00fcrk enacted numerous reforms , many of which incorporated various aspects of Western thought , philosophy , and customs into the new form of Turkish government .   Turkey is a charter member of the UN , an early member of NATO , and a founding member of the OECD , OSCE , OIC and G-20 . After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 , Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963 , joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005 . Turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history .   Turkey 's current administration headed by president Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has reversed many of the country 's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey , such as Freedom of the Press , a Legislative System of Checks and Balances , and a set of standards for secularism in government , as first enacted by Atat\u00fcrk . ","The G20 -LRB- or G-20 or Group of Twenty -RRB- is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies . It was founded in 1999 with the aim of studying , reviewing , and promoting high-level discussion of policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability . It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization . The G20 heads of government or heads of state have periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008 , and the group also hosts separate meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors .   The members include 19 individual countries and along with the European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- . The EU is represented by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank . Collectively , the G20 economies account for around 85 % of the gross world product -LRB- GWP -RRB- , 80 % of world trade -LRB- or , if excluding EU intra-trade , 75 % -RRB- , and two-thirds of the world population .   With the G20 growing in stature after its inaugural leaders ' summit in 2008 , its leaders announced on 25 September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations . Since its inception , the G20 's membership policies have been criticized by numerous intellectuals , and its summits have been a focus for major protests by anti-globalists , nationalists and others .   The heads of the G20 nations met semi-annually at G20 summits between 2009 and 2010 . Since the November 2011 Cannes summit , all G20 summits have been held annually . "]}

Henry was the second Tudor monarch , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is best known for his six marriages and , in particular , his efforts to have his first marriage , to Catherine of Aragon , annulled . His disagreement with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation , separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England . Despite his resulting excommunication , Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , he greatly expanded royal power during his reign . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer all figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars , particularly with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , as he sought to enforce his claim to the Kingdom of France . At home , he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 and following the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' . He was an author and composer . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI . "]}

Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance , that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure ; but it often refers also to its solid state -LRB- ice -RRB- or its gaseous state -LRB- steam or water vapor -RRB- . It also occurs in nature as snow , glaciers , ice packs and icebergs , clouds , fog , dew , aquifers , and atmospheric humidity .   Water covers 71 % of the Earth 's surface . It is vital for all known forms of life . On Earth , 96.5 % of the planet 's crust water is found in seas and oceans , 1.7 % in groundwater , 1.7 % in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland , a small fraction in other large water bodies , and 0.001 % in the air as vapor , clouds -LRB- formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air -RRB- , and precipitation . Only 2.5 % of this water is freshwater , and 98.8 % of that water is in ice -LRB- excepting ice in clouds -RRB- and groundwater . Less than 0.3 % of all freshwater is in rivers , lakes , and the atmosphere , and an even smaller amount of the Earth 's freshwater -LRB- 0.003 % -RRB- is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products . A greater quantity of water is found in the earth 's interior .   Water on Earth moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation and transpiration -LRB- evapotranspiration -RRB- , condensation , precipitation , and runoff , usually reaching the sea . Evaporation and transpiration contribute to the precipitation over land . Large amounts of water are also chemically combined or adsorbed in hydrated minerals .   Safe drinking water is essential to humans and other lifeforms even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients . Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world , but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation . There is a clear correlation between access to safe water and gross domestic product per capita . However , some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the world population will be facing water-based vulnerability . A report , issued in November 2009 , suggests that by 2030 , in some developing regions of the world , water demand will exceed supply by 50 % .   Water plays an important role in the world economy . Approximately 70 % of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture . Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world . Much of long-distance trade of commodities -LRB- such as oil and natural gas -RRB- and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas , rivers , lakes , and canals . Large quantities of water , ice , and steam are used for cooling and heating , in industry and homes .

The court of King Narai -LRB- 1656 -- 88 -RRB- had strong links with that of King Louis XIV of France , whose ambassadors compared the city in size and wealth to Paris .   By 1550 , the kingdom 's vassals included some city-states in the Malay Peninsula , Sukhothai , Lan Na and parts of Burma and Cambodia . This part of the Kingdom 's history is sometimes referred to as ` The Ayutthayan Empire . '   In foreign accounts , Ayutthaya was called Siam , but many sources say the people of Ayutthaya called themselves Tai , and their kingdom Krung Tai `` The Tai country '' . It was also referred to as Iudea in a painting that was requested by the Dutch East India Company ","Spaniards are a nation and ethnic group indigenous to Spain that share a common Spanish culture and speak one of the national languages of Spain , including most numerously Spanish , as a primary language . Within Spain , there are a number of nationalisms and regionalisms , reflecting the country 's complex history and diverse culture . Although the official language of Spain is commonly known as `` Spanish '' , it is only one of the national languages of Spain , and is less ambiguously known as Castilian , a standard language based on the medieval romance speech of the early Kingdom of Castile in north-central Spain and the Mozarabic dialect of the Taifa of Toledo which was incorporated by the former in the 11th century . There are several commonly spoken regional languages , most notably Basque -LRB- a Paleohispanic language -RRB- , Catalan and Galician -LRB- both Romance languages like Castilian -RRB- . There are many populations outside Spain with ancestors who emigrated from Spain and who share a Hispanic culture ; most notably in Hispanic America .   The Roman Republic conquered Iberia during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC . As a result of Roman colonization , the majority of local languages , with the exception of Basque , stem from the Vulgar Latin . The Germanic Vandals and Suebi , with part of the Iranian Alans under King Respendial conquered the peninsula in 409 AD . The Iberian Peninsula was conquered and brought under the rule of the Arab Umayyads in 711 and by the Berber North African dynasties the Almohads and the Almoravids in the 11th and 12th centuries . Following the eight century Reconquista , the modern Spanish state was formed with the union of the Kingdoms of Castille and Aragon , the conquest of the last Muslim kingdom of Granada and the Canary Islands in the late 15th century . In the early 16th century the Kingdom of Navarre was also conquered . As Spain expanded its empire in the America 's , religious minorities in Spain were either converted or expelled and the Catholic church fiercely persecuted heresy during a period known as the Spanish inquisition . In parallel , a wave of emigration began to the Americas began with over 16 million people emigrating to the Americas during the colonial period -LRB- 1492-1832 -RRB- . In the post-colonial period -LRB- 1850 -- 1950 -RRB- , a further 3.5 million Spanish left for the Americas , particularly Argentina , Uruguay , Mexico , Brazil , Chile , Venezuela , Puerto Rico and Cuba . As a result , Spanish-descendants in Latin America number in the hundreds of millions .   Spain is home to one of the largest communities of Romani people -LRB- commonly known by the English exonym `` gypsies '' , Spanish : gitanos -RRB- . The Spanish Roma , which belong to the Iberian Kale subgroup -LRB- cal\u00e9 -RRB- , are a formerly-nomadic community , which spread across Western Asia , North Africa , and Europe , first reaching Spain in the 15th century . The population of Spain is becoming increasingly diverse due to recent immigration . From 2000 to 2010 , Spain had among the highest per capita immigration rates in the world and the second highest absolute net migration in the World -LRB- after the USA -RRB- and immigrants now make up about 10 % of the population . Nevertheless , the prolonged economic crisis between 2008 and 2015 significantly reduced both immigration rates and the total number of foreigners in the country , Spain becoming once more a net emigrant country .

He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages . He was the first recognised emperor in western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier . The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded was called the Carolingian Empire .   Charlemagne was the oldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon . He became king in 768 following his father 's death , initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I. Carloman 's sudden death in 771 in unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne as the undisputed ruler of the Frankish Kingdom . He continued his father 's policy towards the papacy and became its protector , removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain . He campaigned against the Saxons to his east , Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden . Charlemagne reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter 's Basilica .   Charlemagne has been called the `` Father of Europe '' -LRB- Pater Europae -RRB- , as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Roman Empire . His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance , a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church . All Holy Roman Emperors considered their kingdoms to be descendants of Charlemagne 's empire , up to the last Emperor Francis II and the French and German monarchies .   However , the Eastern Orthodox Church views Charlemagne more controversially , labelling as heterodox his support of the filioque and recognition by the Bishop of Rome as legitimate Roman Emperor , rather than recognising Irene of Athens of the Eastern Roman Empire . These and other machinations led to the eventual split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054 .   Charlemagne died in 814 , having ruled as emperor for thirteen years .

Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos , and designed album covers . He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his generation .

While in his teens , he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Var\u00e8se , Igor Stravinsky , and Anton Webern , along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music . He began writing classical music in high school , while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands ; later switching to electric guitar .

Zappa 's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed `` Project\/Object '' , with numerous musical phrases , ideas , and characters reappearing across his albums . His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes , structures and movements , often humorously so .

","South Africa , officially the Republic of South Africa -LRB- RSA -RRB- , is the southernmost country in Africa . It is bounded on the south by 2,798 km of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans , on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia , Botswana and Zimbabwe , and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland , and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho . South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area , and with close to 56 million people , is the world 's 24th-most populous nation . It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere . About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry , divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages , nine of which have official status . The remaining population consists of Africa 's largest communities of European -LRB- white -RRB- , Asian -LRB- Indian -RRB- , and multiracial -LRB- coloured -RRB- ancestry .   South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures , languages , and religions . Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution 's recognition of 11 official languages , which is among the highest number of any country in the world . Two of these languages are of European origin : Afrikaans developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured South Africans ; English reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life , though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken first language . The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'\u00e9tat , and regular elections have been held for almost a century . However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994 . During the 20th century , the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority , with this struggle playing a large role in the country 's recent history and politics . The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948 , institutionalising previous racial segregation . After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country , discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from 1990 onwards .   Since 1994 , all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country 's democracy , which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces . South Africa is often referred to as the `` Rainbow Nation '' to describe the country 's multicultural diversity , especially in the wake of apartheid . The World Bank classifies South Africa as an upper-middle-income economy , and a newly industrialised country . Its economy is the second-largest in Africa , and the 34th-largest in the world . In terms of purchasing power parity , South Africa has the seventh-highest per capita income in Africa .

Before his reign , Philip occupied an exalted place in the royal family of France as a grandson of King Louis XIV . His father , Louis , the Grand Dauphin , had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain when it became vacant in 1700 . However , since neither the Grand Dauphin nor Philip 's older brother , Louis , Duke of Burgundy , could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne , King Charles II of Spain named Philip as his heir in his will . It was well known that the union of France and Spain under one monarch would upset the balance of power in Europe , such that other European powers would take steps to prevent it . Indeed , Philip 's accession in Spain provoked the 14-year War of the Spanish Succession , which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish thrones .   Philip was the first member of the House of Bourbon to rule as king of Spain . The sum of his two reigns , 45 years and 21 days , is the longest in modern Spanish history .

Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar ; to the north and northeast by France , Andorra , and the Bay of Biscay ; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean . It is the only European country to have a border with an African country -LRB- Morocco -RRB- and its African territory accounts for nearly 5 % of its population , mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla .   With an area of 505990 km2 , Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe , the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union , and the fourth largest country in the European continent . By population , Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union . Spain 's capital and largest city is Madrid ; other major urban areas include Barcelona , Valencia , Seville , Bilbao and M\u00e1laga .   Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago . Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician , Greek and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE , after which the region was named Hispania , based on the earlier Phoenician name Span or Spania . In the Middle Ages , the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors . Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century , following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the eight centuries-long reconquest , or Reconquista from the Moors in 1492 . In the early modern period , Spain became one of history 's first global colonial empires , leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish speakers , making Spanish the world 's second most spoken first language , after Mandarin Chinese .

It involved the vast majority of the world 's countries -- including all of the great powers -- eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . It was the most widespread war in history , and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries . In a state of `` total war '' , the major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources .

Under the Molotov -- Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , the Balkan Campaign as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic . On 22 June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis ' military forces into a war of attrition . In December 1941 , Japan attacked the United States and European colonies in the Pacific Ocean , and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific .   The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway , near Hawaii , and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then , decisively , at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union . In 1943 , with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front , the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender , and Allied victories in the Pacific , the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts . In 1944 , the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France , while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies . During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma , while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands .   The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union , culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 . Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms , the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively . With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent , the possibility of additional atomic bombings , and the Soviet Union 's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria , Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 . Thus ended the war in Asia , cementing the total victory of the Allies .   World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world . The United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts . The victorious great powers -- the United States , the Soviet Union , China , the United Kingdom , and France -- became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers , setting the stage for the Cold War , which lasted for the next 46 years . Meanwhile , the influence of European great powers waned , while the decolonisation of Asia and Africa began . Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery . Political integration , especially in Europe , emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and to create a common identity . ","The Blitz , from the German word Blitzkrieg meaning ` lightning war ' , was the name used by the British press to describe the heavy air raids carried out over Britain in 1940 and 1941 , during the Second World War .   The German air offensive was concentrated , aimed at the direct bombing of industrial targets and civilian centres which began with heavy raids on London during the latter phase of the battle for air superiority over the United Kingdom which became known as the Battle of Britain . By September 1940 the Luftwaffe had failed to gain air superiority . The German air fleets -LRB- Luftflotten -RRB- were ordered to attack London , thereby drawing RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation . Adolf Hitler and commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe -LRB- German Air Force -RRB- Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring , sanctioned the change in emphasis on 6 September 1940 .   From 7 September 1940 , just over a year into the war , London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 out of the following 57 days and nights . On 15 September 1940 , a large daylight attack against London was repulsed with significant German losses . Thereafter , the Luftwaffe gradually decreased daylight operations in favour of nocturnal attacks , to avoid RAF defences . The Blitz became a fundamental night bombing campaign after October 1940 .   Ports and industrial centres outside London were also attacked . The main Atlantic sea port of Liverpool was bombed . The North Sea port of Hull , a convenient and easily found target or secondary target for bombers unable to locate their primary targets , was subjected to raids in the Hull Blitz during the war . Other ports including Bristol , Cardiff , Portsmouth , Plymouth , Southampton and Swansea were also bombed , as were the industrial cities of Birmingham , Belfast , Coventry , Glasgow , Manchester and Sheffield . More than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged and more than 40,000 civilians were killed , almost half of them in the capital .   By May 1941 , the threat of an invasion of Britain had ended , and Hitler 's attention turned to Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union . The bombing failed to demoralise the British into surrender or significantly damage the war economy . The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand . The German offensive 's greatest effect was forcing the dispersal of aircraft production and parts . British wartime studies concluded that cities generally took 10 to 15 days to recover when hit severely but exceptions like Birmingham took three months .   The German air offensive failed for several reasons . In particular , the Luftwaffe High Command -LRB- Oberkommando der Luftwaffe , OKL -RRB- did not develop a methodical strategy for destroying British war industry : German effort was diverted and dispersed against several sets of industries instead of maintaining pressure on any of them .

It was released on 17 September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , on 18 November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows . It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008 's Grand Theft Auto IV . Set within the fictional state of San Andreas , based on Southern California , the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency . The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas ' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos , based on Los Angeles .   The game is played from either a first-person or third-person view and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle . Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch between them both during and outside of missions . The story is centred on the heist sequences , and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay . A `` wanted '' system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes . Grand Theft Auto Online , the online multiplayer mode , lets up to 30 players explore the open world and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches .   Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV 's release and was shared between many of Rockstar 's studios worldwide . The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 , and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors . Much of the development work constituted the open world 's creation , and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team . The game 's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years .   Extensively marketed and widely anticipated , the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history , earning US $ 800 million in its first day and US $ 1 billion in its first three days . It received widespread critical acclaim , with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design , open world , presentation and gameplay . However , it caused controversies related to its depiction of women and a mission featuring torture during a hostage interrogation . Considered one of seventh generation console gaming 's most significant titles and among the best games ever made , it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications . It has shipped over 80 million copies and is one of the best-selling video games of all time .

In September 2009 , the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released . It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games . It was lighter and thinner than the original version , and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start-up change in software . A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console .   The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover , particularly after the introduction of the Slim model . As of March 2016 , PlayStation 3 has sold 85 million units worldwide , putting it about on par with Xbox 360 , but behind the Wii .

Xbox One 's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360 's , with a redesigned body , D-pad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback . The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing , as well as social networking features , and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay , or live-stream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch . Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices . The console can play Blu-ray Disc , and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide . The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor , marketed as the `` Kinect 2.0 '' , providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition for use in its graphical user interface -LRB- GUI -RRB- and games .   Xbox One received mostly positive reception for its refined controller design , multimedia features , and voice navigation . Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor on-launch , but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4 . Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive , although changes made to it and other aspects of the console 's software post-launch received positive reception .

In August 2016 , Microsoft released a refreshed Xbox One model known as Xbox One S ; it has a streamlined design , native support for 4K video playback and upscaling , and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color . It was praised for its smaller size , its on-screen visual improvements , and its lack of an external power supply , but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted . A future hardware revision codenamed `` Project Scorpio '' is scheduled for late-2017 ; it will feature major hardware upgrades focused on enabling 4K gameplay and support for virtual reality hardware , and will be backward compatible with all existing Xbox One software and hardware . ","PlayStation 4 -LRB- PS4 -RRB- is a line of home video game consoles developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment . Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 during a press conference on February 20 , 2013 , it was launched on November 15 in North America , November 29 in Europe , South America and Australia ; and February 22 , 2014 , in Japan . It competes with Nintendo 's Wii U and Microsoft 's Xbox One , as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles .   Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor , the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit -LRB- APU -RRB- built upon the x86-64 architecture , which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops ; AMD stated that it was the `` most powerful '' APU it had developed to date . The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services , including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices -LRB- `` Remote Play '' -RRB- , the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends , with them controlling gameplay remotely -LRB- `` Share Play '' -RRB- . The console 's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3 , with improved buttons and analog sticks , and an integrated touchpad among other changes . The console also supports HDR10 high-dynamic-range color and playback of 4K multimedia .   Reception to the original PlayStation 4 model was positive , with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers ' needs , embrace of independent game development , and for not imposing restrictive digital rights management schemes that Microsoft had previously announced for Xbox One prior to its release . Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors ; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as being `` significant '' and `` obvious '' . Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales . By the end of 2016 , more than 53 million consoles have been sold worldwide , with more than 57 million shipped .   On September 7 , 2016 , Sony unveiled two hardware revisions of PlayStation 4 ; a slim build of the console , and a `` Pro '' version with an upgraded GPU and higher CPU clock rate to support 4K gameplay on supported titles .

Harding appointed no one to the State department.","evidence_en":["Warren Gamaliel Harding -LRB- November 2 , 1865 -- August 2 , 1923 -RRB- was the 29th President of the United States , serving from March 4 , 1921 , until his death in 1923 . At the time of his death , he was one of the most popular presidents , but the subsequent exposure of scandals that took place under his administration , such as Teapot Dome , eroded his popular regard , as did revelations of an affair by Nan Britton , one of his mistresses . In historical rankings of the U.S. presidents , Harding is often rated among the worst .   Harding was born in Blooming Grove , Ohio . He lived in rural Ohio all his life , except when political service took him elsewhere . He settled in Marion when not yet 20 years old and bought The Marion Star , building it into a successful newspaper . In 1899 , he was elected to the Ohio State Senate and , after four years there , successfully ran for lieutenant governor . He was defeated for governor in 1910 , but was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1914 .   Harding ran for the Republican nomination for president in 1920 , but he was considered an also-ran with little chance of success . The leading candidates , such as General Leonard Wood , could not gain a majority to secure the nomination , and the convention deadlocked . Harding 's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot . He conducted a front porch campaign , remaining for the most part in Marion and allowing the people to come to him . He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs , running on a theme of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president .   Harding appointed a number of well-regarded figures , including Andrew Mellon at the Treasury , Herbert Hoover at Commerce and Charles Evans Hughes at the State Department . A major foreign policy achievement came with the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 -- 1922 , in which the world 's major naval powers agreed on a naval limitations program that lasted a decade . Two members of his cabinet were implicated in corruption : Interior Secretary Albert Fall and Attorney General Harry Daugherty . The resulting scandals did not fully emerge until after Harding 's death , nor did word of his extramarital affairs , but both greatly damaged his reputation . Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco while on a western speaking tour ; he was succeeded by his vice president , Calvin Coolidge . "]}

{"id":122671,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"My Sweet Lord was written as a paean to the Hindu god Krishna.","evidence_en":["`` My Sweet Lord '' is a song by English musician and former Beatle , George Harrison . It was released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass . Also issued as a single , Harrison 's first as a solo artist , `` My Sweet Lord '' topped charts worldwide and was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK . In America and Britain , the song was the first number one single by an ex-Beatle . Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 .   Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's much-admired slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as being `` musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro '' . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording .   Later in the 1970s , `` My Sweet Lord '' was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit , due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song `` He 's So Fine '' , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright `` Oh Happy Day '' , a Christian hymn , as his inspiration for the song 's melody .   Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked the song as `` My Sweet Lord -LRB- 2000 -RRB- '' for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass . Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams , Peggy Lee , Edwin Starr , Johnny Mathis , Nina Simone , Julio Iglesias , Richie Havens , Megadeth , Boy George , Elton John , Jim James , Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith . `` My Sweet Lord '' is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of `` the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002 , two months after Harrison 's death . "]}

Romney was the father of Mitt Romney.","evidence_en":["George Wilcken Romney -LRB- July 8 , 1907 -- July 26 , 1995 -RRB- was an American businessman and Republican Party politician . He was chairman and president of American Motors Corporation from 1954 to 1962 , the 43rd Governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969 , and the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1969 to 1973 . He was the father of former Governor of Massachusetts and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and the husband of former Michigan U.S. Senate candidate Lenore Romney .   Romney was born to American parents living in the Mormon colonies in Mexico ; events during the Mexican Revolution forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child . The family lived in several states and ended up in Salt Lake City , Utah , where they struggled during the Great Depression . Romney worked in a number of jobs , served as a Mormon missionary in the United Kingdom , and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them . In 1939 he moved to Detroit and joined the American Automobile Manufacturers Association , where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during World War II and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements . He joined Nash-Kelvinator in 1948 , and became the chief executive of its successor , American Motors Corporation , in 1954 . There he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact Rambler car . Romney mocked the products of the `` Big Three '' automakers as `` gas-guzzling dinosaurs '' and became one of the first high-profile , media-savvy business executives . Devoutly religious , he presided over the Detroit Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .   Having entered politics by participating in a state constitutional convention to rewrite the Michigan Constitution during 1961 -- 1962 , Romney was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962 . Re-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966 , he worked to overhaul the state 's financial and revenue structure , greatly expanding the size of state government and introducing Michigan 's first state income tax . Romney was a strong supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement . He briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican Barry Goldwater during the 1964 U.S. presidential election . He requested the intervention of federal troops during the 1967 Detroit riot .   Initially a front runner for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 1968 election , he proved an ineffective campaigner and fell behind Richard Nixon in polls . After a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the Vietnam War had been due to a `` brainwashing '' by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam , his campaign faltered even more and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968 . After Nixon 's election as president , he appointed Romney as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . Romney 's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor , and for open housing to desegregate suburbs , were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon . Romney left the administration at the start of Nixon 's second term in 1973 . Returning to private life , he advocated volunteerism and public service , and headed the National Center for Voluntary Action and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991 . He also served as a regional representative of the Twelve within his church . "]}

Los Angeles is the center of the Los Angeles metropolitan area , and is part of the larger designated Los Angeles-Long Beach combined statistical area -LRB- CSA -RRB- , the second most populous in the nation with a 2015 estimated population of 18.7 million .   Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva , Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California . The city was officially founded on September 4 , 1781 , by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve . It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence . In 1848 , at the end of the Mexican -- American War , Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , thereby becoming part of the United States . Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4 , 1850 , five months before California achieved statehood . The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city . The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913 , delivering water from Eastern California , later assured the city 's continued rapid growth .   Nicknamed the `` City of Angels '' , Los Angeles is known for its Mediterranean climate , ethnic diversity , and sprawling metropolis . The city is also one of the most substantial economic engines within the nation , with a diverse economy in a broad range of professional and cultural fields . Los Angeles is also famous as the home of Hollywood , a major center of the world entertainment industry .

","A Mediterranean climate -LSB- \u02ccm\u025bd\u026at\u0259\u02c8re\u026ani\u0259n -RSB- or dry summer climate , is the climate typical of areas in the Mediterranean Basin . The Mediterranean climate is usually characterized by rainy winters and dry , warm to hot summers . While the climate receives its name from the Mediterranean Sea , an area where this climate is commonplace , it is also present in other areas of the planet , although with variations in the distribution of temperatures . In addition to the Mediterranean Basin , the climate is also found in most of California , in parts of Western and South Australia , in southwestern South Africa , sections of Western and Central Asia , and in Central Chile .   Outside of the Mediterranean Basin , the Mediterranean climate is usually located geographically on the western coasts of continental masses , typically between oceanic climates towards the poles , and semi-arid and arid climates towards the Equator . In essence , a Mediterranean climate is a combination of the three climates with winters somewhat mimicking winters in oceanic climates and summers imitating dry seasons in semi-arid and arid climates . Additionally , Mediterranean climates tend to be wetter poleward and drier the closer it gets to the Equator .   The resulting vegetation of Mediterranean climates are the garrigue in the Mediterranean Basin , the chaparral in California , the fynbos in South Africa and the Chilean scrubland in Chile . Areas with this climate are where the so-called `` Mediterranean trinity '' has traditionally developed : wheat , vine and olive . The latter is a tree that is only grown in areas that have this climatic pattern . "]}

It is one of eight B vitamins . It is involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body , especially affecting DNA synthesis , fatty acid and amino acid metabolism . No fungi , plants , or animals -LRB- including humans -RRB- are capable of producing vitamin B12 . Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes needed for its synthesis . Some substantial sources of B12 include animal products -LRB- shellfish , meat -RRB- , fortified food products , and dietary supplements . B12 is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation synthesis , typically used to manufacture B12 for fortified foods and supplements .   Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds -LRB- vitamers -RRB- , all of which show pharmacological activity . It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt -LRB- chemical symbol Co -RRB- positioned in the center of a planar tetra-pyrrole ring called a corrin ring . The vitamer is produced by bacteria as hydroxocobalamin , but conversion between different forms of the vitamin occurs in the body after consumption .   Vitamin B12 was discovered as a result of its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia , an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed ; these cells are also responsible for secreting acid in the stomach . Because intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of B12 , its lack in the presence of pernicious anemia causes a vitamin B12 deficiency . Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated . Due to impairment of vitamin B12 absorption during aging , people over age 60 are at risk of deficiency . "]}

Its neighbours include China -LRB- officially the People 's Republic of China , PRC -RRB- to the west , Japan to the northeast , and the Philippines to the south .  Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations , and also possesses the largest economy of any state outside of the UN .   The island of Taiwan , also known as Formosa , was mainly inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the 17th century , when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island to Han Chinese immigration . After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning , the island was annexed by the Qing dynasty , the last dynasty of China . The Qing ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War . While Taiwan was under Japanese rule , the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- was established on the mainland in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty . Following the Japanese surrender to the Allies in 1945 , the ROC took control of Taiwan . However , the resumption of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC 's loss of the mainland to the Communists , and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949 . Although the ROC continued to claim to be the legitimate government of China , its effective jurisdiction since 1949 has been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding islands , with the main island making up 99 % of its de facto territory . As a founding member of the United Nations , the ROC continued to represent China at the United Nations until 1971 , when the PRC assumed China 's seat , causing the ROC to lose its UN membership .   In the early 1960s , Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization , creating a stable industrial economy . In the 1980s and early 1990s , it changed from a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party democracy with a semi-presidential system . Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy in the world , and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy . It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press , healthcare , public education , economic freedom , and human development . The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree .   The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence . Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC . Today only a few smaller nations recognize the ROC as the sole legal representative of China , but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates . Although Taiwan is fully self-governing , most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor . Internally , the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence , though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal . The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible . "]}

He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire , a role that he had originated successfully on Broadway . He received further praise for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront , and his portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture .

The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 .   The Statue of Liberty is a robed female figure representing Libertas , the Roman goddess . She holds a torch above her head , and in her left arm carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' -LRB- July 4 , 1776 -RRB- , the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence . A broken chain lies at her feet . The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States , and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad .   Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician \u00c9douard Ren\u00e9 de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples . Due to the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. would provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions .   The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the New York World started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was constructed in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland .   The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service . Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916 . "]}

Headquartered in Louisville , Kentucky , it is the world 's second-largest restaurant chain -LRB- as measured by sales -RRB- after McDonald 's , with almost 20,000 locations globally in 123 countries and territories . The chain is a subsidiary of Yum ! Brands , a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains .   KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders , an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin , Kentucky during the Great Depression . Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept , and the first `` Kentucky Fried Chicken '' franchise opened in Utah in 1952 . KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry , diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger . By branding himself as `` Colonel Sanders '' , Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history , and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising . However , the company 's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y. Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964 .   KFC was one of the first American fast food chains to expand internationally , opening outlets in Canada , the United Kingdom , Mexico , and Jamaica by the mid-1960s . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , it experienced mixed fortunes domestically , as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business . In the early-1970s , KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein , which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate ; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo . The chain continued to expand overseas , however , and in 1987 , it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China . It has since expanded rapidly in China , which is now the company 's single largest market . PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants , which later changed its name to Yum ! Brands .   KFC 's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces , seasoned with Sanders ' recipe of 11 herbs and spices . The constituents of the recipe represent a notable trade secret . Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard `` bucket '' , which has become a well known feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957 . Since the early 1990s , KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet burgers and wraps , as well as salads and side dishes , such as French fries and coleslaw , desserts , and soft drinks , the latter often supplied by PepsiCo . KFC is known for its slogans `` Finger Lickin ' Good '' , `` Nobody does chicken like KFC '' and `` So good '' . "]}
