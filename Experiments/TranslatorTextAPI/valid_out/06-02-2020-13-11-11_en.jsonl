Nepal does not border Bangladesh , which is located within only 27 km -LRB- 17 mi -RRB- of its southeastern tip . Neither does it border Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between . Nepal has a diverse geography , including fertile plains , subalpine forested hills , and eight of the world 's ten tallest mountains , including Mount Everest , the highest point on Earth . Kathmandu is the nation 's capital and largest city . It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language .   The territory of Nepal has a recorded history since the Neolithic age . The name `` Nepal '' is first recorded in texts from the Vedic Age , the era which founded Hinduism , the predominant religion of the country . In the middle of the first millennium BCE , Gautama Buddha , the founder of Buddhism , was born in southern Nepal . Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet . The Kathmandu Valley in central Nepal became known as Nepal proper because of its complex urban civilisation . It was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala . The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley 's traders . The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture . By the 18th century , the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal . The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire , under its Rana dynasty of premiers . The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and Colonial India . In the 20th century , Nepal ended its isolation and forged strong ties with regional powers . Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 , but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs in 1960 and 2005 . The Nepalese Civil War resulted in the proclamation of a republic in 2008 , ending the reign of the world 's last Hindu monarchy .   Modern Nepal is a federal secular parliamentary republic . It has seven states . Nepal is a developing nation , ranking 144th on the Human Development Index -LRB- HDI -RRB- in 2016 . The country struggles with the transition from a monarchy to a republic .

{"id":27985,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"Plutonium reacts with an element.","evidence_en":["Plutonium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Pu and atomic number 94 . It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air , and forms a dull coating when oxidized . The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states . It reacts with carbon , halogens , nitrogen , silicon and hydrogen . When exposed to moist air , it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70 % in volume , which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric . It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones , which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous .   Plutonium was first produced and isolated on December 14 , 1940 by Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg , Joseph W. Kennedy , Edwin M. McMillan , and Arthur C. Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California , Berkeley . They first synthesized neptunium-238 -LRB- half-life 2.1 days -RRB- which subsequently beta-decayed to form a new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 -LRB- half-life 87.7 years -RRB- . Uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune , and so element 94 was named after Pluto , which at the time was considered to be a planet as well . Wartime secrecy prevented them from announcing the discovery until 1948 . Plutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature , as trace quantities similarly arise from natural uranium-238 capturing neutrons . Plutonium is much more common on Earth since 1945 as a product of neutron capture and beta decay , where some of the neutrons released by the fission process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239 .   Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile , meaning that they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction , leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors . Plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission , raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it . The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample 's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel , and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade -LRB- weapons-grade , fuel-grade , or reactor-grade -RRB- . Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles . It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators , which are used to power some spacecraft . Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate , so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors .   Producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs . The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945 , and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945 , had plutonium cores . Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent , and several criticality accidents , some lethal , occurred after the war . Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern . Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests , now banned . "]}

His style was influenced by gospel music , country music , and rhythm and blues acts , and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school . He made his first appearance on local television in 1952 , and the following year he formed the group `` Buddy and Bob '' with his friend Bob Montgomery . In 1955 , after opening for Elvis Presley , Holly decided to pursue a career in music . He opened for Presley three times that year ; his band 's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll . In October that year , when he opened for Bill Haley & His Comets , Holly was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall , who helped him get a contract with Decca Records .   Holly 's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley . Unhappy with Bradley 's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there , Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis , New Mexico , and recorded a demo of `` That 'll Be the Day '' , among other songs . Petty became the band 's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records , which released it as a single credited to `` The Crickets '' , which became the name of Holly 's band . In September 1957 , as the band toured , `` That 'll Be the Day '' topped the US `` Best Sellers in Stores '' chart and the UK Singles Chart . Its success was followed in October by another major hit , `` Peggy Sue '' .   The album Chirping Crickets , released in November 1957 , reached number five on the UK Albums Chart . Holly made his second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1958 and soon after , toured Australia and then the UK . In early 1959 , Holly assembled a new band , consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings -LRB- bass -RRB- , famed session musician Tommy Allsup -LRB- guitar -RRB- , and Carl Bunch -LRB- drums -RRB- , and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. .

Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political .   By the late 1960s `` classic rock '' period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene . New genres that emerged included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down , energetic social and political critiques . Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave , post-punk and eventually alternative rock . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock\/post-punk and synth-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s -LRB- decade -RRB- .   Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements , leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s . Similarly , 1970s punk culture spawned the goth and emo subcultures . Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song , rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race , sex and drug use , and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity . ","Blues is a genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century . The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions , African-American work songs ,  spirituals , and folk music . Blues incorporated spirituals , work songs , field hollers , shouts , chants , and rhymed simple narrative ballads . The blues form , ubiquitous in jazz , rhythm and blues and rock and roll , is characterized by the call-and-response pattern , the blues scale and specific chord progressions , of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common . Blue notes -LRB- or `` worried notes '' -RRB- , usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch , are also an essential part of the sound . Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove .   Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics , bass lines , and instrumentation . Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times . It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard : the AAB pattern , consisting of a line sung over the four first bars , its repetition over the next four , and then a longer concluding line over the last bars . Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative , often relating the troubles experienced in African-American society .   Many elements , such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes , can be traced back to the music of Africa . The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community , the spirituals . The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and , later , the development of juke joints . It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves . Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century . The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908 . Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres . Blues subgenres include country blues , such as Delta blues and Piedmont blues , as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago blues and West Coast blues . World War II marked the transition from acoustic to electric blues and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience , especially white listeners . In the 1960s and 1970s , a hybrid form called blues rock evolved . ","Jazz is a music genre that originated in African American communities of New Orleans , United States , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , and developed from roots in blues and ragtime . Since the 1920s Jazz Age , jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression . It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles , all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation . Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes , call and response vocals , polyrhythms and improvisation . Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression , and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime , as well as European military band music . Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States , different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well . Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as `` one of America 's original art forms '' .   As jazz spread around the world , it drew on different national , regional , and local musical cultures , which gave rise to many distinctive styles . New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s , combining earlier brass-band marches , French quadrilles , biguine , ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation . In the 1930s , heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands , Kansas City jazz , a hard-swinging , bluesy , improvisational style and Gypsy jazz -LRB- a style that emphasized musette waltzes -RRB- were the prominent styles . Bebop emerged in the 1940s , shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging `` musician 's music '' which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation . Cool jazz developed in the end of the 1940s , introducing calmer , smoother sounds and long , linear melodic lines .   The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz , which explored playing without regular meter , beat and formal structures , and in the mid-1950s , hard bop emerged , which introduced influences from rhythm and blues , gospel , and blues , especially in the saxophone and piano playing . Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s , using the mode , or musical scale , as the basis of musical structure and improvisation . Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s , combining jazz improvisation with rock music 's rhythms , electric instruments , and highly amplified stage sound . In the early 1980s , a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful , garnering significant radio airplay . Other styles and genres abound in the 2000s , such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz . "]}

Rockefeller helped create Rockefeller & Andrews.","evidence_en":["John Davison Rockefeller Sr. -LRB- July 8 , 1839 -- May 23 , 1937 -RRB- was an American oil industry business magnate and philanthropist . He is widely considered the wealthiest American of all time , and the richest person in modern history .   Born into a large family in upstate New York , he was shaped by his con man father and religious mother . His family moved several times before eventually settling in Cleveland , Ohio . Rockefeller became an assistant bookkeeper at the age of 16 , and went into a business partnership with Maurice B. Clark and his brothers at 20 . After buying them out , he and his brother William founded Rockefeller & Andrews with Samuel Andrews . Instead of drilling for oil , he concentrated on refining . In 1867 , Henry Flagler entered the partnership . The Rockefeller , Andrews & Flagler company grew by incorporating local refineries . Rockefeller formally founded the Standard Oil Company , Inc. in 1870 as an Ohio partnership with his brother , Henry Flagler , Jabez A. Bostwick , Samuel Andrews , and a silent partner , Stephen V. Harkness . He ran it until 1897 . As kerosene and gasoline grew in importance , Rockefeller 's wealth soared and he became the richest person in the country , controlling 90 % of all oil in the United States at his peak . Oil was used throughout the country as a light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile . Furthermore , Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry , which transported his oil around the country . Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States . Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry , and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie , defined the structure of modern philanthropy .   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil must be dismantled for violation of federal anti-trust laws ; it was broken up into 34 separate entities that included companies that would become ExxonMobil , Chevron , and others ; some of them still having the largest revenue . Individual pieces of the company were worth more than the whole , and as shares of these doubled and tripled in value in their early years , Rockefeller became the country 's first billionaire with a fortune worth nearly 2 percent of the national economy . His peak net worth was estimated at $ 336 billion -LRB- in 2007 USD ; inflation-adjusted -RRB- in 1913 . Rockefeller spent the last 40 years of his life in retirement at his estate in Westchester County , New York . His fortune was mainly used to create the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy through the creation of foundations that had a major effect on medicine , education and scientific research . His foundations pioneered the development of medical research and were instrumental in the eradication of hookworm and yellow fever .   Rockefeller was also the founder of both the University of Chicago and Rockefeller University and funded the establishment of Central Philippine University in the Philippines . He was a devout Northern Baptist , and supported many church-based institutions . Rockefeller adhered to total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco throughout his life . He was a faithful congregant of the Erie Street Baptist Mission Church , where he taught Sunday school , and served as a trustee , clerk , and occasional janitor . Religion was a guiding force throughout his life , and Rockefeller believed it to be the source of his success . Rockefeller was also considered a supporter of capitalism based on a perspective of social Darwinism , and was quoted often as saying `` The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest '' .

It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called `` the Matrix '' , created by sentient machines to subdue the human population , while their bodies ' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source . Computer programmer `` Neo '' learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines , which involves other people who have been freed from the `` dream world . ''   The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as `` bullet time '' , in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera 's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed . The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre . It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas , and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato 's Allegory of the Cave , Jean Baudrillard 's Simulacra and Simulation and Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland . The Wachowskis ' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film 's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions .   The Matrix was first released in the United States on , 1999 , and grossed over $ 460 million worldwide . It was generally well-received by critics and won four Academy Awards , as well as other accolades , including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards . Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects , cinematography and entertainment value . The film 's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works and praised for being intriguing . The action also polarized critics , some describing it as impressive , but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise .   The film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films , and , in 2012 , was added to the National Film Registry for preservation . The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels , both written and directed by the Wachowskis : The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions . The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books , video games and animated short films , in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved . "]}

Edward was the eldest son of George V and Mary of Teck . He was named Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday , nine weeks after his father succeeded as king . As a young man , he served in the British Army during the First World War and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father .   Edward became king on his father 's death in early 1936 . However , he showed impatience with court protocol , and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions . Only months into his reign , he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson , an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second . The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage , arguing that a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort . Additionally , such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward 's status as the titular head of the Church of England , which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive . Edward knew that the British government , led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , would resign if the marriage went ahead , which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch . When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne , Edward abdicated . He was succeeded by his younger brother , George VI . With a reign of 326 days , Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history .   After his abdication , he was created Duke of Windsor . He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937 , after her second divorce became final . Later that year , the couple toured Germany . During the Second World War , he was at first stationed with the British Military Mission to France but , after private accusations that he held Nazi sympathies , he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas . After the war , Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France . "]}

The film stars Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam Hemsworth , Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks , Lenny Kravitz , Stanley Tucci , and Donald Sutherland . The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem , where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must take part in the Hunger Games , a televised annual event in which the `` tributes '' are required to fight to the death until there is only one survivor .

Joined by her district 's male tribute , Peeta Mellark -LRB- Hutcherson -RRB- , Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy -LRB- Harrelson -RRB- .   Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force , which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier . Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay . The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow .

{"id":131020,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist.","evidence_en":["Subhas Chandra Bose -LRB- 23 January 1897 -- 18 August 1945 -RRB- was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India , but whose attempt during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy . The honorific Netaji -LRB- Hindustani : `` Respected Leader '' -RRB- , first applied in early 1942 to Bose in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin , was later used throughout India .   Bose had been a leader of the younger , radical , wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s , rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939 . However , he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command . He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940 .   Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941 , where the leadership offered unexpected , if sometimes ambivalent , sympathy for the cause of India 's independence , contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities . In November 1941 , with German funds , a Free India Centre was set up in Berlin , and soon a Free India Radio , on which Bose broadcast nightly . A 3,000-strong Free India Legion , comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps , was also formed to aid in a possible future German land invasion of India . By spring 1942 , in light of Japanese victories in southeast Asia and changing German priorities , a German invasion of India became untenable , and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia . Adolf Hitler , during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942 , suggested the same , and offered to arrange for a submarine . During this time Bose also became a father ; his wife , or companion , Emilie Schenkl , whom he had met in 1934 , gave birth to a baby girl in November 1942 . Identifying strongly with the Axis powers , and no longer apologetically , Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943 . In Madagascar , he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943 .   With Japanese support , Bose revamped the Indian National Army -LRB- INA -RRB- , then composed of Indian soldiers of the British Indian army who had been captured in the Battle of Singapore . To these , after Bose 's arrival , were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and Singapore . The Japanese had come to support a number of puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions , such as those in Burma , the Philippines and Manchukuo . Before long the Provisional Government of Free India , presided by Bose , was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Bose had great drive and charisma -- creating popular Indian slogans , such as `` Jai Hind , '' -- and the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region , ethnicity , religion , and even gender . However , Bose was regarded by the Japanese as being militarily unskilled , and his military effort was short-lived . In late 1944 and early 1945 the British Indian Army first halted and then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack on India . Almost half the Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent were killed . The INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula , and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore . Bose had earlier chosen not to surrender with his forces or with the Japanese , but rather to escape to Manchuria with a view to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to be turning anti-British . He died from third degree burns received when his plane crashed in Taiwan . Some Indians , however , did not believe that the crash had occurred , with many among them , especially in Bengal , believing that Bose would return to gain India 's independence .   Indian National Congress , the main instrument of Indian nationalism , praised Bose 's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology , especially his collaboration with Fascism . The British Raj , though never seriously threatened by the INA , charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials , but eventually backtracked in the face both of popular sentiment and of its own end .

The order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids , cuttlefish and nautiloids . Like other cephalopods , the octopus is bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak , with its mouth at the centre point of the arms . The soft body , with its lack of internal or external skeleton , can rapidly alter its shape , appearance and colour , enabling the octopus to squeeze through small gaps . The mantle cavity is used both for respiration and for locomotion , by expelling a jet of water . Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight , and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates .   Octopuses inhabit various regions of the ocean , including coral reefs , pelagic waters , and the seabed ; some occur in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths . Most species grow fast , mature early and are short-lived . During breeding , the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female 's mantle cavity , after which he goes into a decline . The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch , after which she also dies .   Octopuses have numerous strategies for to defend themselves against predators , including the expulsion of ink , the use of camouflage and deimatic displays , their ability to jet quickly through the water , and their ability to hide . They trail their eight arms behind them as they swim . All octopuses are venomous , but only one group , the blue-ringed octopuses , is known to be deadly to humans . Around 300 species are recognised .   Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu , and probably the Gorgon of ancient Greece . A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo 's book Toilers of the Sea , inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming 's Octopussy . Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art , shunga .

Officially , its territory consists of the whole Korean Peninsula and its adjacent islands , which are largely mountainous . South Koreans lead a distinctive urban lifestyle , as half of them live in high-rises concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area with 25 million residents and the world 's sixth leading global city with the fourth largest economy and seventh most sustainable city in the world .   The earliest neolithic Korean pottery dates to 8000 BC , with three kingdoms flourishing in the 1st century BC . The name Korea is derived from one of them , Goguryeo , also known as Kory\u014f , which was a Han Chinese tributary state kingdom in East Asia that sent yearly tribute to the Emperor of China , ruling most of the Korean Peninsula and a small portion of Siberia and Inner Mongolia under Gwanggaeto the Great . Since their unification into Later Silla and Balhae in the 7th century , Korea enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under long lasting dynasties . Under Sejong the Great in the 15th century , Koreans had one of the highest living standards in the world along with the Han Chinese and Japanese and developed improved versions many advanced innovations such as the metal movable type printing press in 1377 A.D. which was developed based on the previous Han Chinese Porcelain movable type printing press , used to print and publish the Jikji , the world 's oldest extant movable metal type printed paper book using the 8,000 year old traditional ancient Chinese writing system . Additionally , in 1443 Hangul was invented by the Korean King Sejong the Great as an easier alternative to the complex and difficult to learn ancient Chinese writing system which was usually reserved for elite academic scholars preparing for the imperial examinations of China . Hangul enabled anyone in the general Korean population to easily learn to read and write and transfer written information rather than spending years learning complicated ancient Chinese . Its rich and vibrant culture left 19 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity , the third largest in the world , along with 12 World Heritage Sites . Annexed into Imperial Japan in 1910 , Korea was divided after its surrender in 1945 , but a North Korean invasion led to the Korean War -LRB- 1950 -- 1953 -RRB- . Peace has since mostly continued with the two agreeing to work peacefully for reunification and the South solidifying peace as a regional power with the world 's 10th largest defence budget .   South Korea , along with Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong -LRB- China -RRB- is one of the four high-tech industrialized developed countries often referred to as the Four Asian Economic Dragons . The South Korean economy soared at an annual average of 10 % for over 30 years in a period of rapid transformation called the Miracle on the Han River . A long legacy of openness and focus on innovation made it successful . Today , it is the world 's seventh largest advanced economy and fifth largest exporter with the G20 's largest budget surplus and highest credit rating of any country in East Asia . It has free trade agreements with 75 % of the world economy and is the only G20 nation trading freely with China , the US and the EU simultaneously . Since 1988 , its constitution guarantees a liberal democracy with high government transparency and many fundamental rights such as universal healthcare . High personal freedoms led to the rise of a globally influential pop culture such as K-pop and K-drama , a phenomenon called the Korean Wave , known for its distinctive fashionable and trendy style . Home of the UN Green Climate Fund and GGGI , South Korea is a leader in low carbon green growth , committed to helping developing countries as a major DAC and Paris Club contributor . It is the world 's third least ignorant country in the Index of Ignorance , ranking eighth highest for peaceful tolerance and inclusion of minorities on the Fragile States Index .   South Korea is a technologically advanced developed country driven by a highly educated and skilled workforce , having the world 's eighth highest median household income , the highest in Asia . Globally , it ranks highly in personal safety , job security , ease of doing business and healthcare quality , with the world 's third highest health adjusted life expectancy and fourth most efficient healthcare system . It is the world 's largest spender on R&D per GDP , leading the OECD in graduates in science and engineering and ranking third in the Youth Wellbeing Index . Home of Samsung , LG and Hyundai-Kia , South Korea was named the world 's most innovative country for 4 consecutive years since 2014 in the Bloomberg Innovation Index , ranking first in business R&D intensity , manufacturing value-added , patents filed per GDP , second in higher education efficiency and fourth in high-tech density and researcher concentration .

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering 9.98 e6km2 , making it the world 's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area . Canada 's border with the United States is the world 's longest binational land border . The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate , but southerly areas are warm in summer . Canada is sparsely populated , the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains . It is highly urbanized with 82 per cent of the 35.15 million people concentrated in large and medium-sized cities , many near the southern border . One third of the population lives in the three largest cities : Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver . Its capital is Ottawa , and other major urban areas include Calgary , Edmonton , Quebec City , Winnipeg and Hamilton .   Various aboriginal peoples had inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British and French claims were made on the area , with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1535 during Jacques Cartier 's second voyage to New France . As a consequence of various conflicts , Great Britain gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left , in the late 18th century , with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today . Pursuant to the British North America Act , on July 1 , 1867 , the colonies of Canada , New Brunswick , and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada . This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada .   In 1931 , Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931 , but at the time , Canada decided to allow the British Parliament to temporarily retain the power to amend Canada 's constitution , on request from the Parliament of Canada . With the Constitution Act 1982 , Canada took over that authority -LRB- as the conclusion of Patriation -RRB- , removing the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom , giving the country full sovereignty .   Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy , with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state . The country is officially bilingual at the federal level . It is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations , the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries . Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Canada 's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture .

The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven , where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit , and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers .

Throughout its history , Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations . Worldwide , the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism . The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East -- West Schism of 1054 ; Protestantism came into existence in the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Catholic Church .

Rodr\u00edguez is the career record holder for grand slams with 25 . However , he has led a highly controversial career due to signing two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history while incurring criticism from the media for his behavior and use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs .   The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft , and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18 .

Rodriguez 's combination of power , speed , and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise , but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers . The 10-year , $ 252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history . He played at a high level in his three years with Texas , highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003 , but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure . Prior to the 2004 season , Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees , for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop Derek Jeter .

He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs , reaching the milestone in 2007 . He won his first World Series in 2009 , which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium . The following year , he became the career leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent .

In February 2009 , after previously denying use of performance-enhancing drugs , including during a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes , Rodriguez admitted to using steroids , saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for Rangers due to `` an enormous amount of pressure '' to perform . While recovering from a hip injury in 2013 , Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal . In August 2013 , MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the scandal , but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment . Had the original suspension been upheld , it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history .

They were first discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773 . The name Tardigrada -LRB- meaning `` slow stepper '' -RRB- was given three years later by the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani . They have been found everywhere from mountaintops to the deep sea , mud volcanoes , and from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic .   Tardigrades are one of the most resilient animals known : they can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms . They can withstand temperature ranges from 1 K -LRB- close to absolute zero -RRB- to about 420 K for several minutes , pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches , ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human , and the vacuum of outer space . They can go without food or water for more than 30 years , drying out to the point where they are 3 % or less water , only to rehydrate , forage , and reproduce . Tardigrades living in harsh conditions undergo an annual process of cyclomorphosis .   They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions . This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments , whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms .   Usually , tardigrades are about 0.5 mm long when they are fully grown . They are short and plump with four pairs of legs , each with four to eight claws also known as `` disks '' . The first three pairs of legs are directed ventrolaterally and are the primary means of locomotion , while the fourth pair is directed posteriorly on the terminal segment of the trunk and is used primarily for grasping the substrate . Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells , algae , and small invertebrates . When collected , they may be viewed under a very low-power microscope , making them accessible to students and amateur scientists .   Tardigrades form the phylum Tardigrada , part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa . It is an ancient group , with fossils dating from 530 million years ago , in the Cambrian period . About 1,150 species of tardigrades have been described . Tardigrades can be found throughout the world , from the Himalayas -LRB- above 6000 m -RRB- , to the deep sea -LRB- below 4000 m -RRB- and from the polar regions to the equator . "]}

The original settlement , named Gastown , grew up on clearcuts on the west edge of the Hastings Mill logging sawmill 's property , where a makeshift tavern had been set up on a plank between two stumps and the proprietor , Gassy Jack , persuaded the curious millworkers to build him a tavern , on 1 July 1867 . From that first enterprise , other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west . Gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed Granville , B.I. -LRB- `` B.I '' standing for `` Burrard Inlet '' -RRB- . As part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the Canadian Pacific Railway -LRB- CPR -RRB- , it was renamed `` Vancouver '' and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city , in 1886 . By 1887 , the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport , which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient , Eastern Canada , and Europe .  , Port Metro Vancouver is the third largest port by tonnage in the Americas -LRB- displacing New York -RRB- , 27th in the world , the busiest and largest in Canada , and the most diversified port in North America .  While forestry remains its largest industry , Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature , making tourism its second-largest industry .  Major film production studios in Vancouver and Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America ,  earning it the film industry nickname , Hollywood North .

It was released in May 2016 for Windows , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One .   Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six , with each player selecting one of 24 pre-defined characters , called heroes , each with unique movement , attributes , and abilities , whose roles are divided into four categories : Offense , Defense , Tank , and Support . Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a limited amount of time . Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay , such as character skins and victory poses , as they play the game . The game was initially launched with casual play , with a competitive ranked mode , various ` arcade ' game modes , and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release . Additionally , Blizzard has developed and added new characters , maps , and game modes post-release , while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free , with the only additional cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards .   Overwatch is Blizzard 's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of the ambitious massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan . A portion of the Titan team came up with the concept of Overwatch , based on the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the growing popularity of multiplayer online battle arenas , creating a hero-based shooter that emphasized teamwork . Some elements of Overwatch borrow assets and concepts from the canceled Titan project . After establishing the narrative of an optimistic near-future Earth setting after a global crisis , the developers aimed to create a diverse cast of heroes that spanned genders and ethnicities as part of this setting . Significant time was spent adjusting the balance of the characters , making sure that new players would still be able to have fun while skilled players would present each other with a challenge .   Overwatch was unveiled at BlizzCon 2014 in a fully playable state and was in a closed beta from late 2015 through early 2016 . An open beta in May 2016 drew in more than 9.7 million players . The release of the game was promoted with short animated videos to introduce the game 's narrative and each of the characters . Upon official release , Overwatch received universal acclaim from critics , who praised the game for its accessibility , diverse appeal of its hero characters , bright cartoonish art style , and enjoyable gameplay . Considered one of the best games released in 2016 , the game received numerous accolades , including being awarded Game of the Year at The Game Awards , D.I.C.E. Awards , and Game Developers Choice Awards , as well as from numerous publications .

Papua New Guinea is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world . There are 852 known languages in the country , of which 12 now have no known living speakers . Most of the population of more than 7 million people live in customary communities , which are as diverse as the languages . It is also one of the most rural , as only 18 percent of its people live in urban centres . The country is one of the world 's least explored , culturally and geographically . It is known to have numerous groups of uncontacted peoples , and researchers believe there are many undiscovered species of plants and animals in the interior .   Papua New Guinea is classified as a developing economy by the International Monetary Fund . Strong growth in Papua New Guinea 's mining and resource sector led to the country becoming the sixth fastest-growing economy in the world in 2011 . Growth was expected to slow once major resource projects came on line in 2015 . Mining remains a major economic factor , however . Local and national governments are discussing the potential of resuming mining operations in Panguna mine in Bougainville Province , which has been closed since the civil war in the 1980s -- 1990s . Nearly 40 percent of the population lives a self-sustainable natural lifestyle with no access to global capital .   Most of the people still live in strong traditional social groups based on farming . Their social lives combine traditional religion with modern practices , including primary education . These societies and clans are explicitly acknowledged by the Papua New Guinea Constitution , which expresses the wish for `` traditional villages and communities to remain as viable units of Papua New Guinean society '' and protects their continuing importance to local and national community life .

As of 2013 , the region employed about a quarter of a million information technology workers .   As more high-tech companies were established across the Santa Clara Valley , and then north towards the Bay Area 's two other major cities , San Francisco and Oakland , the `` Silicon Valley '' name eventually came to refer to all high-tech businesses in the region . The term is now generally used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector .

Roosevelt was born.","evidence_en":["Franklin Delano Roosevelt -LRB- -LSB- \u02c8ro\u028az\u0259v\u0259lt -RSB- , his own pronunciation , or -LSB- - en \u02c8ro\u028az\u0259v\u025blt -RSB- January 30 , 1882 -- April 12 , 1945 -RRB- , commonly known as FDR , was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945 . A Democrat , he won a record four presidential elections and emerged as a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century . He directed the United States government during most of the Great Depression and World War II . As a dominant leader of his party , he built the New Deal Coalition , realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System and defining American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century . He is often rated by scholars as one of the three greatest U.S. Presidents , along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln .   Roosevelt was born in 1882 to an old , prominent Dutch family from Dutchess County , New York and attended Groton School . He went on to graduate from Harvard College in 1903 and attended Columbia Law School . At age 23 in 1905 , he married Eleanor Roosevelt , and the couple went on to have six children . He entered politics in 1910 , serving in the New York State Senate , and then as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson . In 1920 , presidential candidate James M. Cox selected Roosevelt as his running mate , but the Cox\/Roosevelt ticket lost to the Republican ticket of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge . In 1921 , Roosevelt was stricken with debilitating polio , which cost him the use of his legs . The disability put his future political career in jeopardy , but he attempted to recover from the illness and founded the treatment center in Warm Springs , Georgia for people with polio . Roosevelt returned to political life when he nominated Alfred E. Smith at the 1924 Democratic National Convention . At Smith 's behest , Roosevelt successfully ran for Governor of New York in 1928 . He was in office from 1929 to 1933 and served as a reform governor , promoting the enactment of programs to combat the depression besetting the United States at the time .   In the 1932 presidential election , Roosevelt defeated incumbent Republican president Herbert Hoover in a landslide to win the presidency . Roosevelt took office while the United States was in the midst of the worst economic crisis in its history . Energized by his personal victory over polio , FDR relied on his persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit . During his first 100 days in office , Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal -- a variety of programs designed to produce relief -LRB- government jobs for the unemployed -RRB- , recovery -LRB- economic growth -RRB- , and reform -LRB- through regulation of Wall Street , banks and transportation -RRB- . He created numerous programs to support the unemployed and farmers , and to encourage labor union growth while more closely regulating business and high finance . His support for the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 added to his popularity , helping him win re-election by a landslide in 1936 . The economy improved rapidly from 1933 -- 37 , but then relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 -- 38 . The bipartisan Conservative Coalition that formed in 1937 prevented his packing the Supreme Court , and blocked almost all proposals for major liberal legislation -LRB- except the minimum wage , which did pass -RRB- . When the war began and unemployment ended , conservatives in Congress repealed the two major relief programs , the Works Progress Administration -LRB- WPA -RRB- and Civilian Conservation Corps -LRB- CCC -RRB- . However , they kept most of the regulations on business . Along with several smaller programs , major surviving programs include the Securities and Exchange Commission , the Wagner Act , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Social Security .   With World War II looming after 1938 with the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany , Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China and the United Kingdom , while remaining officially neutral . His goal was to make America the `` Arsenal of Democracy '' , which would supply munitions to the Allies . In March 1941 , Roosevelt , with Congressional approval , provided Lend-Lease aid to Britain and China . Following the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , which he famously called `` a date which will live in infamy '' , Roosevelt sought and obtained the quick approval on the following day for Congress to declare war on Japan and , a few days later , on Germany . Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins , and with very strong national support , he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allies against Nazi Germany , Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan in World War II . He supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort , and also ordered the internment of 100,000 Japanese American civilians . As an active military leader , Roosevelt implemented a war strategy on two fronts that ended in the defeat of the Axis Powers , and he initiated the development of the world 's first atomic bomb . His work also influenced the later creation of the United Nations and Bretton Woods . Roosevelt 's physical health seriously declined during the war years , and he died weeks into his fourth term . He was then succeeded by his vice president Harry S. Truman , and a few months after Truman 's inauguration , the United States bombed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , leading to Japan 's surrender . "]}

It is nonmetallic and tetravalent -- making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds . Three isotopes occur naturally , C and C being stable , while C is a radioactive isotope , decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years . Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity .   Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth 's crust , and the fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass after hydrogen , helium , and oxygen . Carbon 's abundance , its unique diversity of organic compounds , and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element to serve as a common element of all known life . It is the second most abundant element in the human body by mass -LRB- about 18.5 % -RRB- after oxygen .   The atoms of carbon can bond together in different ways , termed allotropes of carbon . The best known are graphite , diamond , and amorphous carbon . The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form . For example , graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent . Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper -LRB- hence its name , from the Greek verb '' \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd '' which means `` to write '' -RRB- , while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known . Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity . Under normal conditions , diamond , carbon nanotubes , and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials . All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions , with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form . They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen .   The most common oxidation state of carbon in inorganic compounds is +4 , while +2 is found in carbon monoxide and transition metal carbonyl complexes . The largest sources of inorganic carbon are limestones , dolomites and carbon dioxide , but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of coal , peat , oil , and methane clathrates . Carbon forms a vast number of compounds , more than any other element , with almost ten million compounds described to date , and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions . For this reason , carbon has often been referred to as the `` king of the elements '' . "]}

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962 , Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group . Because of his unorthodox approaches to song composition and arrangement and mastery of recording techniques , he is widely acknowledged , by critics and musicians alike , as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music .   In the mid-1960s , Wilson composed , arranged and produced Pet Sounds -LRB- 1966 -RRB- , considered one of the greatest albums ever made . The intended follow-up to Pet Sounds , Smile , was canceled for various reasons , which included Wilson 's deteriorating mental health . As he suffered repeated nervous breakdowns , Wilson 's contributions to the Beach Boys diminished , and his erratic behavior led to tensions with the band . Following a court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist Eugene Landy , Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment , and in the late 1990s , he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist . He remains a member of the Beach Boys ' corporation , Brother Records Incorporated .   Wilson is considered a major innovator in the field of music production , the principal originator of the California Sound , one of the first music producer auteurs , and one of the most famous examples of the outsider musician . Only 21 years old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy , he ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers , supplanting New York as the center of popular records , and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as its own instrument . Wilson effectively set a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as their own producers or co-producers . His songs became inextricably tied with the zeitgeist of the early 1960s , and he helped develop the sound of the wistful Flower Power era that proceeded . In later years , Wilson was regarded as a `` godfather '' to an era of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities , chamber pop orchestrations , and recording explorations .

{"id":56339,"label":"SUPPORTS","claim":"Concrete intelligence quotient scores cannot be achieved because intelligence is abstract.","evidence_en":["An intelligence quotient -LRB- IQ -RRB- is a total score derived from several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence . The abbreviation `` IQ '' was coined by the psychologist William Stern for the German term Intelligenzquotient , his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at University of Wroc\u0142aw he advocated in a 1912 book . Historically , IQ is a score obtained by dividing a person 's mental age score , obtained by administering an intelligence test , by the person 's chronological age , both expressed in terms of years and months . The resulting fraction is multiplied by 100 to obtain the IQ score . When current IQ tests were developed , the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as IQ 100 and scores each standard deviation -LRB- SD -RRB- up or down are defined as 15 IQ points greater or less , although this was not always so historically . By this definition , approximately two-thirds of the population scores are between IQ 85 and IQ 115 . About 5 percent of the population scores above 125 , and 5 percent below 75 .   Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence because concrete measurements -LRB- e.g. distance , mass -RRB- can not be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of `` intelligence '' . IQ scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as morbidity and mortality , parental social status , and , to a substantial degree , biological parental IQ . While the heritability of IQ has been investigated for nearly a century , there is still debate about the significance of heritability estimates and the mechanisms of inheritance .   IQ scores are used for educational placement , assessment of intellectual disability , and evaluating job applicants . Even when students improve their scores on standardized tests , they do not always improve their cognitive abilities , such as memory , attention and speed . In research contexts they have been studied as predictors of job performance , and income . They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables . Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century , a phenomenon called the Flynn effect . Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence . "]}

During this time Galloway and Wharton had sold their shares of the Chronicle to a Robert Towne , who in turn made many attempts to persuade Goddard to sell his newspaper to him . After Goddard publicly criticized Galloway and Wharton he subsequently found himself jailed for debt in September 1771 , no doubt at the prompting of the influential Galloway . "]}

Pompeii , along with Herculaneum and many villas in the suzrrounding area , was mostly destroyed and buried under 4 to of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD .   Researchers believe that the town was founded in the seventh or sixth century BC by the Osci or Oscans . It came under the domination of Rome in the 4th century BC , and was conquered and became a Roman colony in 80 BC after it joined an unsuccessful rebellion against the Roman Republic . By the time of its destruction , 160 years later , its population was estimated at 11,000 people , and the city had a complex water system , an amphitheatre , gymnasium , and a port .   The eruption destroyed the city , killing its inhabitants and burying it under tons of ash . Evidence for the destruction originally came from a surviving letter by Pliny the Younger , who saw the eruption from a distance and described the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder , an admiral of the Roman fleet , who tried to rescue citizens . The site was lost for about 1,500 years until its initial rediscovery in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre in 1748 . The objects that lay beneath the city have been preserved for more than a millennium because of the long lack of air and moisture . These artifacts provide an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city during the Pax Romana . During the excavation , plaster was used to fill in the voids in the ash layers that once held human bodies . This allowed archaeologists to see the exact position the person was in when he or she died .   Pompeii has been a tourist destination for over 250 years . Today it has UNESCO World Heritage Site status and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy , with approximately 2.5 million visitors every year . "]}

People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash . People usually do not get the disease more than once . Testing for the virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts .   The measles vaccine is effective at preventing the disease . Vaccination has resulted in a 75 % decrease in deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013 with about 85 % of children globally being currently vaccinated . No specific treatment is available . Supportive care may improve outcomes . This may include giving oral rehydration solution -LRB- slightly sweet and salty fluids -RRB- , healthy food , and medications to control the fever . Antibiotics may be used if a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia occurs . Vitamin A supplementation is also recommended in the developing world .   Measles affects about 20 million people a year , primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia . It causes the most vaccine-preventable deaths of any disease . It resulted in about 73,000 deaths in 2014 , down from 545,000 deaths in 1990 . In 1980 , the disease was estimated to have caused 2.6 million deaths per year . Most of those who are infected and who die are less than five years old . The risk of death among those infected is usually 0.2 % , but may be up to 10 % in those who have malnutrition . It is not believed to affect other animals . Before immunization in the United States , between three and four million cases occurred each year . As a result of widespread vaccination , the disease was eliminated from the Americas by 2016 . "]}

{"id":116474,"label":"REFUTES","claim":"My Sweet Lord is by John Lennon.","evidence_en":["`` My Sweet Lord '' is a song by English musician and former Beatle , George Harrison . It was released in November 1970 on his triple album All Things Must Pass . Also issued as a single , Harrison 's first as a solo artist , `` My Sweet Lord '' topped charts worldwide and was the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the UK . In America and Britain , the song was the first number one single by an ex-Beatle . Harrison originally gave the song to his fellow Apple Records artist Billy Preston to record ; this version , which Harrison co-produced , appeared on Preston 's Encouraging Words album in September 1970 .   Harrison wrote `` My Sweet Lord '' in praise of the Hindu god Krishna , while at the same time intending the lyrics to serve as a call to abandon religious sectarianism through his deliberate blending of the Hebrew word hallelujah with chants of `` Hare Krishna '' and Vedic prayer . The recording features producer Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound treatment and heralded the arrival of Harrison 's much-admired slide guitar technique , which one biographer described as being `` musically as distinctive a signature as the mark of Zorro '' . Preston , Ringo Starr , Eric Clapton , and the group Badfinger are among the other musicians appearing on the recording .   Later in the 1970s , `` My Sweet Lord '' was at the centre of a heavily publicised copyright infringement suit , due to its similarity to the Ronnie Mack song `` He 's So Fine '' , a 1963 hit for the New York girl group the Chiffons . In 1976 , Harrison was found to have subconsciously plagiarised the earlier tune , a verdict that had repercussions throughout the music industry . He claimed to have used the out-of-copyright `` Oh Happy Day '' , a Christian hymn , as his inspiration for the song 's melody .   Harrison performed `` My Sweet Lord '' at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971 , and it remains the most popular composition from his post-Beatles career . He reworked the song as `` My Sweet Lord -LRB- 2000 -RRB- '' for inclusion as a bonus track on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass . Many artists have covered the song including Andy Williams , Peggy Lee , Edwin Starr , Johnny Mathis , Nina Simone , Julio Iglesias , Richie Havens , Megadeth , Boy George , Elton John , Jim James , Bonnie Bramlett and Elliott Smith . `` My Sweet Lord '' is ranked 460th on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of `` the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time '' . The song reached number 1 in Britain for a second time when re-released in January 2002 , two months after Harrison 's death . "]}

Other common symptoms include emotional problems , problems with language , and a decrease in motivation . A person 's consciousness is usually not affected . A dementia diagnosis requires a change from a person 's usual mental functioning and a greater decline than one would expect due to aging . These diseases also have a significant effect on a person 's caregivers .   The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer 's disease , which makes up 50 % to 70 % of cases . Other common types include vascular dementia -LRB- 25 % -RRB- , Lewy body dementia -LRB- 15 % -RRB- , and frontotemporal dementia . Less common causes include normal pressure hydrocephalus , Parkinson 's disease , syphilis , and Creutzfeldt -- Jakob disease among others . More than one type of dementia may exist in the same person . A small proportion of cases run in families . In the DSM-5 , dementia was reclassified as a neurocognitive disorder , with various degrees of severity . Diagnosis is usually based on history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood work used to rule out other possible causes . The mini mental state examination is one commonly used cognitive test . Efforts to prevent dementia include trying to decrease risk factors such as high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , and obesity . Screening the general population for the disorder is not recommended .   There is no cure for dementia . Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are often used and may be beneficial in mild to moderate disorder . Overall benefit , however , may be minor . There are many measures that can improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers . Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate . Educating and providing emotional support to the caregiver is important . Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and potentially improve outcomes . Treatment of behavioral problems with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended due to the little benefit and side effects , including an increased risk of death .   Globally , dementia affected about 46 million people in 2015 . About 10 % of people develop the disorder at some point in their lives . It becomes more common with age . About 3 % of people between the ages of 65 -- 74 have dementia , 19 % between 75 and 84 and nearly half of those over 85 years of age . In 2013 dementia resulted in about 1.7 million deaths up from 0.8 million in 1990 . As more people are living longer , dementia is becoming more common in the population as a whole . For people of a specific age , however , it may be becoming less frequent , at least in the developed world , due to a decrease in risk factors . It is one of the most common causes of disability among the old . It is believed to result in economic costs of 604 billion USD a year . People with dementia are often physically or chemically restrained to a greater degree than necessary , raising issues of human rights . Social stigma against those affected is common . "]}

The Congress meets in the Capitol in Washington , D.C. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election , though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a gubernatorial appointment . Members are usually affiliated to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party , and only rarely to a third party or as independents . Congress has 535 voting members : 435 Representatives and 100 Senators . The House of Representatives has six non-voting members in addition to its 435 voting members . These members can , however , sit on congressional committees and introduce legislation . These members represent Washington , D.C. , Puerto Rico , American Samoa , Guam , the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands .   The members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms representing the people of a single constituency , known as a `` district '' . Congressional districts are apportioned to states by population using the United States Census results , provided that each state has at least one congressional representative . Each state , regardless of population or size , has two senators . Currently , there are 100 senators representing the 50 states . Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term , with terms staggered , so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election . ","The United States Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress which , along with the United States House of Representatives , the lower chamber , composes the legislature of the United States of America .   The composition and powers of the Senate are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The Senate is composed of senators who represent each of the several states , with each state being equally represented by two senators , regardless of their population , serving staggered terms of six years ; with fifty states presently in the Union , there are 100 U.S. Senators . From 1789 until 1913 , Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented ; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 , they are now popularly elected . The Senate chamber is located in the north wing of the Capitol , in Washington , D.C.   As the upper house , the Senate has several powers of advice and consent which are unique to it ; these include the ratification of treaties , the confirmation of Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court justices , federal judges , other federal executive officials , flag officers , regulatory officials , ambassadors , and other federal uniformed officers . In addition to these , in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for Vice President , the duty befalls upon the Senate to elect one of the top two recipients of electors for that office . It further has the responsibility of conducting trials of those impeached by the House . The Senate is widely considered both a more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives due to its longer terms , smaller size , and statewide constituencies , which historically led to a more collegial and less partisan atmosphere .   The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President of the United States , who is President of the Senate ; in their absence , the President Pro Tempore , who is customarily the senior member of the controlling party , presides over the Senate . In the early 20th century , the practice of majority and minority parties electing their floor leaders began , although they are not constitutional officers . ","The United States House of Representatives is the lower chamber of the United States Congress which , along with the Senate , composes the legislature of the United States .   The composition and powers of the House are established by Article One of the United States Constitution . The House is composed of representatives who sit in congressional districts which are allocated to each of the 50 states on a basis of population as measured by the U.S. Census , with each district entitled one representative . Since its inception in 1789 , all representatives are elected popularly . The total number of voting representatives is fixed by law at 435 . As of the 2010 Census , the largest delegation is that of California , with fifty-three representatives ; seven states have the smallest delegation possible , a single representative : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Vermont , and Wyoming .   The House is charged with the passage of federal legislation , known as bills , which , after concurrence by the Senate , are sent to the President for consideration . In addition to this basic power , the House has certain exclusive powers which include the power to initiate all bills related to revenue , the impeachment of federal officers , who are sent to trial in the Senate , and in cases wherein no candidate receives a majority of electors for President , the duty falls upon the House to elect one of the top three recipients of electors for that office , with one vote given to each state for that purpose .   The presiding officer is the Speaker of the House , who is elected by the members thereof and is therefore traditionally the leader of the controlling party . He or she and other floor leaders are chosen by the Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conferences , depending on whichever party has more voting members . The House meets in the south wing of the United States Capitol . "]}

It is bounded by the East Siberian Sea and the Arctic Ocean in the north and the Sea of Okhotsk to the south . The region gets its name from the Kolyma River and mountain range , parts of which were not discovered until 1926 . Today the region consists roughly of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and the Magadan Oblast .   The area , part of which is within the Arctic Circle , has a subarctic climate with very cold winters lasting up to six months of the year . Permafrost and tundra cover a large part of the region . Average winter temperatures range from \u2212 19 \u00b0 C to \u2212 38 \u00b0 C -LRB- even lower in the interior -RRB- , and average summer temperatures , from +3 \u00b0 C to +16 \u00b0 C . There are rich reserves of gold , silver , tin , tungsten , mercury , copper , antimony , coal , oil , and peat . Twenty-nine zones of possible oil and gas accumulation have been identified in the Sea of Okhotsk shelf . Total reserves are estimated at 3.5 billion tons of equivalent fuel , including 1.2 billion tons of oil and 1.5 billion m3 of gas .   The principal town Magadan has nearly 100,000 inhabitants and is the largest port in north-eastern Russia . It has a large fishing fleet and remains open year-round thanks to icebreakers . Magadan is served by the nearby Sokol Airport . There are many public and private farming enterprises . Gold mines , pasta and sausage factories , fishing companies , and a distillery form the city 's industrial base . ","Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au -LRB- from aurum -RRB- and atomic number 79 . In its purest form , it is a bright , slightly reddish yellow , dense , soft , malleable , and ductile metal . Chemically , gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element . It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions . Gold often occurs in free elemental -LRB- native -RRB- form , as nuggets or grains , in rocks , in veins , and in alluvial deposits . It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver -LRB- as electrum -RRB- and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium . Less commonly , it occurs in minerals as gold compounds , often with tellurium -LRB- gold tellurides -RRB- .   Gold 's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher numbered , naturally occurring elements . It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis , from the collision of neutron stars , and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed . Because the Earth was molten when it was formed , almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core . Therefore , most of the gold that is present today in the Earth 's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later , by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment , about 4 billion years ago .   Gold is resistant to most acids , though it does dissolve in aqua regia , a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid , which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion . Gold is insoluble in nitric acid , which dissolves silver and base metals , a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects , giving rise to the term acid test . Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide , which are used in mining and electroplating . Gold dissolves in mercury , forming amalgam alloys , but this is not a chemical reaction .   Historically , the value of gold was rooted in its relative rarity , easy handling and minting , easy smelting and fabrication , resistance to corrosion and other chemical reactions -LRB- nobility -RRB- and its distinctive color . As a precious metal , gold has been used for coinage , jewelry , and other arts throughout recorded history . In the past , a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy , but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s , and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1976 .   A total of 186,700 tonnes of gold is in existence above ground , as of 2015 . The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50 % in jewelry , 40 % in investments , and 10 % in industry . Gold 's high malleability , ductility , resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions , and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices -LRB- its chief industrial use -RRB- . Gold is also used in infrared shielding , colored-glass production , gold leafing , and tooth restoration . Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine . As of 2014 , the world 's largest gold producer by far was China with 450 tonnes . "]}

She starred as Dr. Naomi Bennett on the ABC television drama Private Practice . ","Porgy and Bess is an English-language opera composed in 1934 by George Gershwin , with a libretto written by DuBose Heyward and Ira Gershwin . It was adapted from Heyward 's play Porgy , itself an adaptation of his 1925 novel of the same name .   Porgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30 , 1935 , before it moved to Broadway in New York City . It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers -- a daring artistic choice at the time . After suffering from an initially unpopular public reception due in part to its racially charged theme . In 1976 the Houston Grand Opera production of the opera in 1976 gained it new popularity , eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed operas .   Gershwin read Porgy in 1926 and proposed to Heyward to collaborate on an operatic version . In 1934 , Gershwin and Heyward began work on the project by visiting the author 's native Charleston . In a 1935 New York Times article , Gershwin explained why he called Porgy and Bess a folk opera :  `` Porgy and Bess is a folk tale . Its people naturally would sing folk music . When I first began work in the music I decided against the use of original folk material because I wanted the music to be all of one piece . Therefore I wrote my own spirituals and folksongs . But they are still folk music -- and therefore , being in operatic form , Porgy and Bess becomes a folk opera . ''   The libretto of Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy , a disabled black street-beggar living in the slums of Charleston , South Carolina . It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown , her violent and possessive lover , and Sportin ' Life , her drug dealer . The opera plot generally follows the stage-play .   In the years following Gershwin 's death , Porgy and Bess was adapted for smaller scale performances . It was adapted as a film in 1959 . Some of the songs in the opera , such as `` Summertime '' , became popular and frequently recorded songs .   In the late 20th and early 21st centuries , the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin 's original intentions . Smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted . A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976 ; since then , it has been recorded several times . "]}
